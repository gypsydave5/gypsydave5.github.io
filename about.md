title: About me
---

I'm a graduate of [The University of Warwick] and [Makers Academy] I have been
an academic philosopher, a library van driver, a copy writer, a proof reader and
a digital marketeer.

I try to write good code and then I try to write better code. I like
[software craftsmanship], chess and tea. I believe I'm getting better everyday at
everything I do, and that I will never stop feeling stupid and excited.
