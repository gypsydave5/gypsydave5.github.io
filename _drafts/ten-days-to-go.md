For those who know me, or have been following my [Twitter feed][twit], you may
know that I'll be starting at [Makers Academy][MA] on the 4th of August.
That's in ten days time. Part of the reason I've been keeping this blog is to
monitor my progress in preparing for that day.

So, why Makers?

My New Year's Resolution was to change my life. I didn't want to spend the next
thirty-plus years working in a career I was adequately suited for (marketing)
and being the guy in the department who got to do all the maths-y/computery
stuff while not being at all enthusiastic about... well, about everything else
he was doing. At the time I was having a terrible time in my job (in fact I quit
about week later), and looking to get out.

I sought advice from everyone I knew, and talked incessantly about software
development. I'm blessed with good, patient friends who were happy to put up
with this, a number of who work in the industry. They've steered me and mentored
me over the last few months (specifically [@shapeshed] and [@brooksey]), shown
me where [codecademy][CA] was, and generally answered any of my questions.
Through all of this I recognised that this career change was going to work - the
more I learned the more I wanted to learn, and the more there was to learn. An
interest in tech and programming started to become a passion (my partner can
attest to this - barely an evening without being gllued to the laptop).
I became more confident in my decision.

I mentioned my intentions to my friend Mike. "Oh," he said, "sort of like what
[Josh][Josh] did at that Maker's place?" Apparently our friend had just
come out of Maker's into a good job. So I caught up with Josh who raved about
his experience, and I showed the course to my dev friends. They hadn't heard of
Makers, but were generally impressed by the programme. One expressed concern
about the Ruby/Rails focus, in a world where [NodeJS][Node] was rapidly becoming
the next big thing. They suggested I ask the question.

So I wrote a short email to Makers, asking why Rails? And I got a well thought
out, well written, extensive email in reply, arguing that, yes, Node was
important, but that Makers teachers how to be a developer in a culture/method
sense, and that Rails was just a good platform to start from - not the be all
and end all.

(Incidentally, the email was from [Jordan][Jordan] - took me about a fortnight
to work out, as he freely admits on his [Twitter profile][Jordan], "Yes, I'm
['that' Jordan][Apprentice]".)

Cost was an issue - nobody spends the best part of Â£10,000 pounds on a whim. And
if I could achieve the same results just through educating myself the Makers
experience would be pointless. But I know at least two things about myself

1. I like difficult things
2. I work in intense bursts
3. I work best under pressure

I know that I'd work best with a goal, in an immersive environment, surrounded
by bloody clever people all working towards the same thing and supporting each
other. I took particular note of [this article][CodingHard] by one of the
co-founders of Makers, [Rob Johnson][RJ]. I also knew that I couldn't hang
around, that if this was the right decision then it was the right decision
*now*, and it had to happen as quickly and efficiently as possible.

I looked at other other bootcamps, mainly [General Assembly][GA], who definitely
have scale and experience on their side. But I was sold on Makers after spending
some time with the other finalists of the [#SkimlinksToMakers][SL2M] competition
during the final interviews, and at the Makers open days. Meeting the
instructors (I especially remember talking with [Ruben][RK] - and a slightly
confusing attempt to talk with passion about **Person of Interest**, the Turing
test, chess and some other things. Enthusiastic, yes. Coherent...?). I also read
the (numerous) blogs of former students - I found [Dave Wood][DWood]'s
description pretty exciting and useful, and of course [Josh][JBlog]'s. I also
had a forty-minute phone conversation with Jordan, who again answered all my
questions in an open, non-salesy way. He'd [done the course
himself][JordanBlog], which gave a unique perspective, and spent at least ten
minutes trying to put me off.

He failed. I applied. The interview went well (Jordan *again* - felt like he was
stalking me...), and I spent the next few weeks rapidly reading everything
I could about Ruby and writing as much (bad) code as I could...

... and so here I am, feeling pretty ready. Nervous, and excited. I'm really
looking forward to learning something new everyday.
