On top of this, poking in the guts of Ruby makes you realise that there's no
honour in doing something 'the hard way'. I've been warned to beware of
abstractions at many turns when looking at code - especially with regard to
Rails. But abstractions are only deadly when [reified][reification], that is
when they're no longer treated as abstractions but as real things. And, in that
respect, everything in computer science/software/coding (call it what you like)
is, for the most part, abstraction.
