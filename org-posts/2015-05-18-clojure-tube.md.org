#+TITLE: Clojure on the Tube

#+DATE: [2015-05-18]

Thought I should share this, as it surprised me. I solved one of the
[[http://www.4clojure.com/][4Clojure]] problems on the London
Underground today while commuting home, using my smart phone.

I didn't think it would be possible to write anything useful on such a
small device, but with a bit of persistance I was not only able to write
some Clojure, I was also able to run it inside a REPL to see what I was
doing wrong and iterate on my solution.

If you've got an Android phone the REPL I used was
[[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sattvik.clojure_repl][Clojure
REPL]] and the local instance of the 4Clojure problems were held on the
[[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bytopia.foreclojure][4Clojure
app]]. Both apps are pretty nifty. The only thing that slowed me down
was trying to type all those parens on the native keyboard.

4Clojure is good resource of problems to help learn Clojure; I've been
getting rusty recently as my main focus has been JavaScript. And
planning my wedding.

For the record, this is the function I wrote:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (fn flatn [lst]
    (if (coll? lst)
      (apply concat (map flatn lst))
      [lst]))
#+END_SRC

Note that this was done at the north end of the Victoria line, near
Finsbury Park. I don't think I'd have managed it on the Northern line in
the City...
