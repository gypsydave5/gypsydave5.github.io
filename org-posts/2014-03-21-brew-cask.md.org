[[http://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] is wonderful, and if you're using a Mac to
develop on and aren't using it to manage your command line applications
then I'd be surprised. Actually, I'd assume you were using
[[https://www.macports.org/][MacPorts]].

I've recently started to take advantage of an additonal library of
prebuilt binaries for Homebrew called
[[https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask][Cask]]. This gives access
to many (if not all) of the larger, often graphical, applications that
you need, such as Chrome, IntelliJ, Vagrant... it's a long list.

It even integrates well with my favourite Mac productivity tool,
[[http://www.alfredapp.com/][Alfred]]. And, yes, you can install that
with Cask too.

Set up with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
#+END_SRC

and then install software with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew cask install alfred
#+END_SRC
