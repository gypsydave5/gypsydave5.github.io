#+TITLE: Windows Silver Surfer

#+DATE: [2014-07-07 Mon]

Adding to my list of [[/posts/2014/7/4/surviving-windows/][ways to fix
the Windows experience]], I have to pay due respect to
[[http://blog.kowalczyk.info/][Krystoff Kowalcyzk]], a developer who has
ported
[[http://geoff.greer.fm/2011/12/27/the-silver-searcher-better-than-ack/][Ag
(aka The Silver Surfer)]] over to Windows. He's also authored a really
elegant (and for elegant please read lightweight and customizable) PDF
viewer
[[http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html][SumatraPDF]].
Both of these have improved my life today.

I've been looking at alternatives to Adobe Reader on the Ubuntu box as
well - currently I'm enjoying the simplicity of
[[http://www.mupdf.com/][muPDF]], but there are many other options out
there.
