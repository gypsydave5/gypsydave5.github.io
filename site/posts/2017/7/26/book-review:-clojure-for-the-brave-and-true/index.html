  <h1>Book Review: Clojure for the Brave and True</h1>
  <time datetime="2017-07-26T11:43" >Jul 26, 2017</time>
  <p>One line review: <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/"><em>Clojure for the Brave and True</em></a> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/nonrecursive">Daniel Higginbotham</a> is a pretty good intro to Clojure, if you can get
past the undergraduate humour.</p>

<p><em>Clojure for the Brave and True</em> could be thought of as a part of a loose
trilogy of books, including <a href="http://landoflisp.com/"><em>Land of Lisp</em></a> and <a href="http://realmofracket.com/"><em>Realm of
Racket</em></a>,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> that explore modern Lisps in a light hearted way with
cartoons.</p>

<p>The first problem with this comparison is that <em>Brave &amp; True</em> is nowhere near
as good as <em>Land of Lisp</em> - Barski&rsquo;s jokes are funnier, his cartoons are better,
the content is both deeper and broader. <em>Land of Lisp</em> has
a chapter called &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s build a Web Server from Scratch&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s not lying.
Whereas <em>Brave &amp; True</em> won&rsquo;t even show you the ropes on something like
<a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a>.</p>

<p>The best chapters in <em>Brave and True</em>, which are also the most useful ones, are
the ones where you&rsquo;re being walked through a piece of code line by line. The
&lsquo;<a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/functional-programming/">Peg thing</a>&rsquo; game is a great example of a interactive command-line game
written using a series of pure functions. This chapter gives you a real idea of
how to get some Clojure code doing stuff in the world - a practical toolkit to
let you get writing something.</p>

<p>The other great thing about this book is its opinionated introduction to
editors. I struggled mightily setting up something to do my Lisps in,
having gone through a variety of Vim and Emacs setups with every damn plugin you
can imagine. <em>Brave and True</em> has <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/">an entire chapter dedicated to getting
a decent Emacs environment</a> (you can download the configuration),
complete with Cider and Paredit. It&rsquo;s not going to teach you everything you want
to know, but once you&rsquo;re done you will be immediately productive and able to get
along with the more serious task of actually writing some Clojure.</p>

<p>But I often found the sense of humour in this book grating. It is as if I was
forced to hang around with my fourteen-year-old self.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> The one who&rsquo;d
memorized a lot of <em>Monty Python</em> and <em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> and
thought that quoting it back at my friends was the height of sophisticated
humour. The examples feel contrived to fit the humour, often to the detriment of
the point that is trying to be made.</p>

<p>The poorest chapters are the ones where an idea is introduced but not fully
explored. When introduced to protocols and records it would be nice to
understand how they are used to leverage polymorphism in something more
practical than the contrived Richard-Simmons-as-Werewolf examples that felt even
less useful than the usual Object Oriented Guide to Animal Taxonomy we&rsquo;re forced
to endure.</p>

<p><em>Brave and True</em> is a good book, and is worth buying and reading (and if you
want to sample the content it&rsquo;s all available on <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">the book&rsquo;s excellent website</a>).
It&rsquo;s filled me with confidence to write Clojure (probably before other
languages) and to read more books on Clojure.  I just wish that it had spent
less time crapping around with spurious examples and more time showing me how
and why Clojure is the best.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to read <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">my favourite introduction to Lisp</a> again
(keep scrolling) and maybe finish <em>Land of Lisp</em>.</p>

<li id="fn:2">Bah, OK. My 20 year old self too. I can still sing all of <em>The Philosophers&rsquo; Song</em>, I just know I shouldn&rsquo;t.</li>
