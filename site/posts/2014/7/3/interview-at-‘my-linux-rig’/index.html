  <h1>Interview at &lsquo;My Linux Rig&rsquo;</h1>
  <time datetime="2014-07-03T22:42" >Jul 03, 2014</time>
  <p>A few months ago Steven Ovadia over at <a href="http://www.mylinuxrig.com/">My Linux Rig</a> spotted my post
about <a href="/posts/2014/4/29/late-in-the-day-linux/">the night I installed Linux</a> and asked me if I&rsquo;d like to do a quick
interview about, well, about my Linux setup. Sounded like a good idea so
I answered his questions. He posted <a href="http://www.mylinuxrig.com/post/90468057902/the-linux-setup-david-wickes-software-developer">the interview</a> today if you&rsquo;d
like to look at it.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s any amendments that need to be made now that I&rsquo;ve been using Linux
for, oh, about 20 times as long as I had been, it would have to be that I find
myself wrestling with the system more - but in a good way. I know that I can
make it do the things I want it to if I just invest a bit of time and effort to
find out how. Linux doesn&rsquo;t make me &lsquo;put up and shut up&rsquo; - it actively
encourages me to fix things, make it suit me. This sort of experimentation and
investigation takes time, but it&rsquo;s ultimately very rewarding - I know my way
around my Linux machine better than my Windows set up.</p>

<p>In addition I rarely touch ST3 any more, spending most of my editing time on
Vim as <a href="/posts/2014/6/14/vimmified!/">previously mentioned</a>. And Guake lost its novelty rapidly. Right now I&rsquo;m
sifting through five years of Gmail using <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a>. Now that&rsquo;s something.
And using <a href="http://irssi.org/">irssi</a> to dip my toe into the community with IRC.</p>

<p>Probably the most affecting bit is to see the phrase &lsquo;David Wickes, Software
Developer&rsquo; at the top. I&rsquo;m not a software developer - yet. But I will be soon.
And reading that, well, it made me feel pretty good about myself. Something to
aspire to.</p>
