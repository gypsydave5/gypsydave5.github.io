  <h1>Vimmified!</h1>
  <time datetime="2014-06-14T20:52" >Jun 14, 2014</time>
  <p>I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;ve started to use Vim obsessively over the last week - there
are a number of factors feeding in, mostly centred around my perverse need to do
make something more difficult than is strictly necessary; I&rsquo;m learning Vim
&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s there&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not strictly true - if I&rsquo;m going to blame something it&rsquo;s going to be
Windows Vista. Or, more speifically, the way Windows Vista insists on
sporadically freezing my mouse for 10-20 seconds every fifteen minutes or so.
It starts to add up, killing the flow of the work and slowing me down no end.</p>

<p>So I discovered <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en">Vimium</a>, an extension for Chromium that puts all the
Vim keys into the browser. If you&rsquo;ve used the shortcut keys in Twitter you&rsquo;ll be
right at home (the same with Gmail&rsquo;s shortcuts but slightly less so). It&rsquo;s not
only let me circumvent my mouse when it freezes; I&rsquo;ve found myself using it in
preference to the mouse in most cases, fingers sitting happily on the home keys
as I navigate around the web, mostly without any hold ups. Even if you don&rsquo;t
think you&rsquo;ll use it it&rsquo;s worth installing just to see the way it implements link
clicking.</p>

<p>So having got this far it felt churlish not to go and install Vim, by way of the
Windows build of <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php">Gvim</a>. Now, while I&rsquo;m trying to wean myself off Windows
(made much easier by having a Vista box at work), I am still forced to use it
(oh that Vista box at work). I&rsquo;d been happy up to now with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text
3</a>, which I have synced across all my computers and which also implements
a <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/vintage.html">&lsquo;Vintage&rsquo;</a> (should that be &lsquo;Vimtage&rsquo;) mode with a most of the Vim
commands intact. But it&rsquo;s always worth trying new things I figured, and getting
Vim going nicely on Windows seemed like a fun challenge.</p>

<p>Challenge it was. I love the Sublime Text <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/">Package Manager</a>, which
beautifully lists and installs packages from Sublime Text itself. Very cool.
Looking for something similar in Vim I found <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim/wiki/Vundle-for-Windows">Vundle</a>, which installs
Vim packages directly from Github, locally, or almost anywhere, when they&rsquo;re
listed in the <code>.vimrc</code> configuration file. Like everything in the open-source
community it&rsquo;s all geared up for *nix systems, so takes <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim/wiki/Vundle-for-Windows">a little bit of
tweaking</a> to get going on Windows.</p>

<p>Even more tweaking was required when I decided to take a great leap forward and
put <a href="https://github.com/zaiste/vimified">Vimified</a> on as well, a starting collection of packages for Vim.
Which of course was also <a href="http://kaszkowiak.eu/windows-vimified/">fraught on Windows</a>. But ultimately
successful (even if I did seem to spend at least three days getting the
<a href="https://github.com/bling/vim-airline">Airline/Powerline</a> status bar fonts working).</p>

<p>Half the fun of this little project has been learning how to edit the .vimrc
file - and by extension all *nix config files. More confidence at the command
line can only be a good thing, and a good poke around the workings of Linux has
made me feel a little more confident (even so far as to getting the
<a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline">Powerline</a> fonts working in Bash).</p>

<p>What strikes me as I write this (in Vim - but on the Linux box at home) about
a month on is how swiftly the Vim keys have worked themselves into my average
workflow. I find it faster to open new lines, append lines, and navigate with
J/K than arrows.  Combined with Alt-Tabbing between windows, and Vimium in the
browser, I haven&rsquo;t touched the mouse in creating this document - including all
the copy-pasting of links. I haven&rsquo;t even left the home keys.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not quite happy to leave Sublime Text yet - but I&rsquo;m certainly seeing my way there.</p>
