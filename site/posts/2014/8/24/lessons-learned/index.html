  <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
  <time datetime="2014-08-24T10:20" >Aug 24, 2014</time>
  <p>Things I&rsquo;ve learned so far from my teachers:</p>

<p>###<a href="https://twitter.com/Stephen_lloyd">Stephen</a> - Succinct Semantics###
I felt a little smug about my code when Steve sat next to me to see how I was
doing. I was seeing if there were any broken bikes in an array, something like</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">bikes.select {|bike| bike.broken?}.count &gt; 1
</code></pre>

<p>He took a quick look and pointed out that this was a little on the long side.
Does Ruby have an <code>any?</code> method for <code>Array</code>s? Sure enough, there in <code>Enumerable</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">bikes.any? {|bike| bike.broken?}
</code></pre>

<p>Better. I would have been happy. But Steve then says, try passing a the symbol
for <code>broken?</code> as a proc - something I&rsquo;d seen and not used.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">bikes.any?(&amp;:broken?)
</code></pre>

<p>See how that&rsquo;s better? It says exactly what it does? Yes, I did. And I&rsquo;d learned
that you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice succinctness to semantics and vice versa. Ruby
has enough well-named methods and techniques to create a short statement that
someone who didn&rsquo;t know Ruby would still understand. Lesson learned.</p>

<p>###<a href="https://twitter.com/liviu_23">Mihai</a> - Delete Your Code###
I asked Mihai for some help changing my tests for the Boris Bikes project. I was
trying to change the RSpec tests I&rsquo;d written from <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/123627/what-are-the-london-and-chicago-schools-of-tdd">Chicago to London
style</a> having just been shown how to do doubles.</p>

<p>Start again, Mihai said. Don&rsquo;t be precious or treasure what you&rsquo;ve written
- just get rid of it and start again. You&rsquo;ll learn more that way.</p>

<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve taken immense pleasure in wiping entire projects out. And
learned more by doing that. Lesson learned.</p>

<p>###<a href="https://twitter.com/ecomba">Enrique</a> - Cooking without ever having have Eaten###
Late in the day I asked Enrique about program design. I was worried, really
worried, that I didn&rsquo;t know the right way to proceed with writing a program.
He&rsquo;d just introduced the idea of design patterns that day, so I asked him to
recommend a book, or a checklist, or a mantra - the best way to learn some
patterns.</p>

<p>Even as I spoke, Enrique started moving him hands, miming typing in front of me.
Remember what I said earlier, he said, about coding being entirely artificial.
It&rsquo;s not like cooking where you know what food is and what it tastes like. It&rsquo;s
like cooking when you&rsquo;ve never eaten food, have no idea what good or bad food
tastes like. The only way you&rsquo;ll learn is by writing code, a lot of code. Then
your instincts, your taste and intuition, will improve.</p>

<p>It was only later that I connected this advice up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Bergson#Creativity">Bergson&rsquo;s ideas about
creativity, specifically the swimming example</a>. You wouldn&rsquo;t think
a person could swim if you only ever saw them walk, the argument goes. For
swimming to be intellectually comprehendable, you&rsquo;ve got to throw yourself in
the water first. You can&rsquo;t theorize about things you haven&rsquo;t done - intuition
must take the lead, intelligence is a not a speculative faculty, but a practical one.</p>

<p>Mind blown, I staggered home, ignored <em>The RSpec Book</em> and wrote more code.
Lesson learned.</p>
