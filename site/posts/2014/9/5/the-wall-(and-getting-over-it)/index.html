  <h1>The Wall (and getting over it)</h1>
  <time datetime="2014-09-05T20:24" >Sep 05, 2014</time>
  <p>Ever run a marthon? No, me neither. I&rsquo;ve run a few halfs, so let&rsquo;s pretend
that&rsquo;s adequate experience to talk about marathon running.</p>

<p>Long distance runners talk about this moment when the glycogen in your body runs
out entirely. You&rsquo;ll get about two hours, maybe more if you train. But it&rsquo;ll
happen, and all your energy just - goes. Seratonin levels go up, which might
sound fun until I tell you that your dopamine goes down as well. This might be
causing some of the little voices in your head to tell you that you can&rsquo;t do
it. You may hallucinate. You may not be able to stand.</p>

<p>I hit the mental equivalent of the wall sometime over the week we started
learning <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> at Makers. I&rsquo;d done my preparation,
I&rsquo;d learned and digested solidly. I&rsquo;d say I was one of the better prepared for
the next twelve weeks.</p>

<p>But you can only delay the wall - you can&rsquo;t put it off entirely. I ran out of
whatever mental stamina I had. And it hurt. A lot.</p>

<pre><code>Depressesed? Disheartened? Hate coding? Hate what you're doing to yourself? Hate
Sinatra (the framework)? Hate Sinatra (the singer)? Wonder what you're still
doing here? How *can* anyone learn to code in twelve weeks? Stupid. Impossible.
You'd be better back at the library. Hell, you'd be better back at the cannary.
Stupid brain that won't work. Stupid.
</code></pre>

<p>We can reach for another running metaphor: second wind. Even at the point of
greatest exertion, you can find a way to carry on. Going even faster sometimes.
Like you can push through the wall and find yourself suddenly back to normal
again.</p>

<p>This happened too - and kept happening. Because I didn&rsquo;t just hit one wall. I&rsquo;ve
hit at least three since the first one. You get <em>used</em> to it. Flailing ignorance
and mental exhaustion is aleviated by the next piece of hard-won knowldege and
skill.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found relaxation to be as important as work. I&rsquo;m reading fiction again,
getting to bed in good time, appreciating a quiet beer. Taking your mind off the
problem until it&rsquo;s ready to be solved.</p>

<p>Thinking about philosophy, and Deleuze &amp; Guattari&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus">A Thousand
Plateaus</a>, I think of the
organism that can only grow by dying a little every day. Growth is painful.
Growth is hard. But nothing worthwhile was ever easy.</p>

<p>You beat it. I couldn&rsquo;t do Sinatra, I couldn&rsquo;t make it do what I wanted it to
do. But I made it do something, learned my limitations. And I enjoyed myself.
And now <a href="http://rpssd.gypsydave5.com/">you can play with it</a>.</p>

<p>The pace is picking up this week. Last week threw Sinatra in our faces. This
week is databases. Learning to program is one thing - keeping all these spinning
plates up in the air at the same time is another.</p>

<p>And only half the race run.</p>
