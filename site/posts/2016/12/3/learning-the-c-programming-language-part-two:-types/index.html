  <h1>Learning the C Programming Language<br><h2>Part Two: Types</h2></h1>
  <time datetime="2016-12-03T13:42" >Dec 03, 2016</time>
  <p><em>This post follows on from my <a href="/posts/2016/8/9/learning-the-c-programming-language-part-1:-hello,-world/">first post about the C programming
language</a>, and is the second in a series of posts about learning C</em></p>

<p>C has types - what does that mean? This post is going to focus on types and the
role they perform in C. We&rsquo;re going to show how they&rsquo;re used but, more
importantly, we&rsquo;re going to look at why they&rsquo;re used.</p>

<h2>All the types!</h2>

<p>A type in C is a type of <em>data</em>. For instance, if you want to use a whole number
in C you can use an <code>int</code>, whereas if you want to use a decimal number you would
need a different type of data, say a <code>float</code>.</p>

<p>The first temptation to watch out for, definitely from the Ruby side of my
brain, is to think of types as being like classes. Types are ways of storing
data in a computer (as we&rsquo;ll make clear), and not objects with methods,
inheritance, attributes and all the other object oriented stuff. Forget about
classes.</p>

<p>So to store an integer C has <code>int</code>. But it also has <code>long</code>, which will store
a bigger integer, and, on top of that we have <code>long long</code>, which will store
a <em>really</em> big integer. And if you just happen to know that the number you want
to store is <em>really</em>, <em>really</em> big but will never be negative, you can go so far
as to use the type <code>unsigned long long</code>.</p>

<p>This may all sound a little ridiculous from the point of view of a Rubyist or
a JavaScripter - I mean, I can see why maybe a <code>float</code> is different to an <code>int</code>,
but why do I need all these different ways to talk about integers?</p>

<p>The reason cuts to the heart of what a type system is for, and why C is a lower
level programming language than Ruby and JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Types for the memory</h2>

<p>In C when we declare a variable we declare it with its type:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">int my_number;
</code></pre>

<p>We can then assign a value to it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">int my_number;
my_number = 5;
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby, you&rsquo;d just need the second line, and in JavaScript it would be the same
but <code>int</code> would be replaced with <code>var</code>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s going on under the hood of your computer when you say &ldquo;OK computer,
let&rsquo;s have a variable&rdquo;?</p>

<p>This is the bit where I remember the video of the American politician explaining
that the internet is just a series of tubes.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Well, I&rsquo;m about to be just as
reductivist and say that your computer&rsquo;s memory is &lsquo;just&rsquo; a big long line of
ones and zeroes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/c-types/bits.png" alt="a series zeroes and ones" /></p>

<p>So Matrix.</p>

<p>Each one of these ones and zeroes is called a <em>bit</em> (Binary DigIT - geddit?). And
eight of those in a row is called a <em>byte</em> (no idea, you look it up).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Byte is
a good level of abstraction to work from for C, so let&rsquo;s replace our image of
a <em>very</em> long list of zeroes and ones with a <em>very</em> long row of boxes, each box
holding a byte of information.</p>

<p><img src="/images/c-types/bytes.png" alt="a series of empty boxes" /></p>

<p>Less Matrix, but we&rsquo;re cool, right?</p>

<h2>Why we have types</h2>

<p>So now we need to do something with this memory - write programs! Ok, more
specifically, we need to keep hold of an integer. And we can do this by
reserving a specific portion of that <em>very</em> long row of boxes to keep the number
in. But how many boxes do we need to do that? Well, basic maths tells us that
a single byte could hold any number from 0 up to 255 as long as it&rsquo;s
positive.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Cool - so now we can keep hold of the number 5.</p>

<p><img src="/images/c-types/5-in-one.png" alt="a series of empty boxes" /></p>

<p>But we might need to store much bigger numbers - what if we added 255 to our
that variable, we&rsquo;d not have enough space to store the number 260. So maybe we
should reserve more bytes in memory to hold that number.  How many? I don&rsquo;t
know, maybe 128 of them, just to be safe.</p>

<p><img src="/images/c-types/5-in-128.png" alt="a series of empty boxes" /></p>

<p>But isn&rsquo;t that terribly inefficient?  We&rsquo;d just be reserving a lot of bytes
which would always be <code>0</code> if we never kept a number bigger than 20.  I mean,
this is C - the year is 1971, the most memory we&rsquo;re going to have available is
64KB. We don&rsquo;t want to run out of memory messing around with piddly little
positive integers&hellip; how much space do we need to allocate to store a number?</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have different types for different magnitudes of integer. For
small numbers there&rsquo;s things like <code>char</code> (a single byte) and <code>int</code>, and for
bigger numbers we&rsquo;ve got the mighty <code>long long</code> and <code>unsigned long long</code>.</p>

<p>The type of a variable is the space reserved for it in your computer&rsquo;s
memory.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> C offers us control over memory allocation, at the price of us
actually having to care about memory.</p>

<p>For instance, <code>char</code> which is good for storing information about a single ASCII
characters (more about them later).  But if we need to keep hold of a number
bigger than 255, we can go with <code>int</code>, which is guaranteed to store a number
between âˆ’32767 to 32767, which is two bytes.</p>

<p>We say &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo;, because a system&rsquo;s implementation of C could allocate more
memory to an <code>int</code>, so the C standard tells us the maximum number a type can
definitely store. In reality it&rsquo;s larger - on my Macbook Pro the maximum size of
an <code>int</code> is in fact between -2147483648 and 2147483647 - four bytes in fact.</p>

<h2>Integer overflow</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try some of this stuff out - here&rsquo;s a fun program.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int int_number;
    int_number = 2000000000;
    printf(&quot;int_number: %d\n&quot;, int_number);

    int_number = int_number + 2000000000;
    printf(&quot;int_number + 2000000000: %d\n&quot;, int_number);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we&rsquo;ve got the <code>main()</code> function again, which will runs on execution. We&rsquo;re
declaring  a variable of type <code>int</code> called <code>int_number</code> on line 4 and assigning
it the value of two billion on line 5. Then we&rsquo;re printing it out - <code>printf()</code>
can take a format string as its first argument, allowing later arguments to be
interpolated into the string - <code>%d</code> is the placeholder for an <code>int</code> to be
inserted, so the value of <code>int_number</code> is printed instead of the <code>&amp;d</code> in the
string.</p>

<p>Then we reassign <code>int_number</code> to the value of <code>int_number</code> plus another two
billion. And finally we print out the value of <code>int_number</code> again.</p>

<p>To compile and run it take a look at the <a href="/posts/2016/8/9/learning-the-c-programming-language-part-1:-hello,-world/">first post in this series</a>.
Try it now and see what you get.</p>

<p>Something pretty odd, right? Maybe it&rsquo;ll be different on your computer but here
for me the result of 2000000000 + 200000000 is -294967296. Which is just wrong.</p>

<p>What happened? Well we just experienced <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow">integer overflow</a></em>, where C quite
happily adds two numbers together and stores them in a variable, but if the type
of the variable isn&rsquo;t big enough to hold the new number C will just store as
many bits as it can in the space it&rsquo;s got. Look, try this variation:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int int_number;
    int_number = 2147483647;
    printf(&quot;int_number: %d\n&quot;, int_number);

    int_number = int_number + 1;
    printf(&quot;int_number + 2000000000: %d\n&quot;, int_number);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should get -2147483648, not 2147483648.</p>

<p>Integer overflow is like the moment when all the numbers on your car&rsquo;s odometer
are all 9s, and then they all roll over at once to all the 0s - you&rsquo;ve run out
of space to represent the new number with digits you&rsquo;re using. And for &lsquo;digits&rsquo;
in our example read &lsquo;bits&rsquo; - <code>1111111111111111</code> becomes <code>0000000000000000</code>,
which is the representation of -2147483648 in binary.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>

<h2>Fixing integer overflow</h2>

<p>To solve this problem we need a ~bigger boat~ larger type to store our number
in, which is as easy as changing an <code>int</code> to a <code>unsigned long long</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    unsigned long long int_number;
    int_number = 2000000000;
    printf(&quot;int_number: %d\n&quot;, int_number);

    int_number = int_number + 2000000000;
    printf(&quot;int_number + 2000000000: %d\n&quot;, int_number);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We should now be getting a nice round four billion.</p>

<h2>Types in Ruby and JavaScript</h2>

<p>Ruby and JavaScript also have types - but we just don&rsquo;t get to see them as
often and they&rsquo;re not as granular. <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es5.html#sec-8">JavaScript numbers</a> <em>always</em> take
up 8 bytes - big enough to handle most numbers - and Ruby just switches the
class of a number as it grows between classes like <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Fixnum.html">Fixnum</a> and <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Bignum.html">Bignum</a>. These
are both good solutions, and take away the headache of having to think about the
correct type to use to represent an integer, but also lack the freedom for
us to manage memory directly.</p>

<h2>Practically speaking&amp;hellip;</h2>

<p>In practice when I write C, I start with using <code>int</code>s, wait until I see errors
that are due to integer oveflow, and then find and replace to change the <code>int</code>s
to <code>long long</code> or <code>unsigned long long</code>. In practice, on my highly specced modern
computer, I&rsquo;m not too worried about tinkering with how much memory I&rsquo;m using for
my toy C programs.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s nice to know I can.</p>

<li id="fn:4">Eight ones, <code>11111111</code>, in binary is 255 in decimal.</li>

<li id="fn:5">This may be a contentious statement, and is worthy of another post, but here I&rsquo;m refering to type as early programmers would have understood the idea of a type of data, rather than the types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theory</a>, based on Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox">set theoretic paradoxes</a>, which was later brought in to computer science by way of Alonzo Church and languages like ML and which functional programmers tend to wax lyrical about in languages like Scala. Take a look at <a href="http://arcanesentiment.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/a-brief-history-of-type.html">this blog post</a> and <a href="http://lists.seas.upenn.edu/pipermail/types-list/2014/001781.html">this short post</a>.</li>

<li id="fn:6">If you want to know <em>why</em> this is, take a look at some articles on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement">Two&rsquo;s Complement</a>. <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html">This one</a> is pretty good too. <code>unsigned</code> types don&rsquo;t have to worry about this and so can consequently store larger, non-negative integers.</li>
