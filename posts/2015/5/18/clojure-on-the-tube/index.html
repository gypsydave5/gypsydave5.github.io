  <h1>Clojure on the Tube</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-05-18T20:39" >May 18, 2015</time>
  <p>Thought I should share this, as it surprised me. I solved one of
the <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4Clojure</a> problems on the London Underground today while commuting home,
using my smart phone.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it would be possible to write anything useful on such a small
device, but with a bit of persistance I was not only able to write some Clojure,
I was also able to run it inside a REPL to see what I was doing wrong and
iterate on my solution.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got an Android phone the REPL I used was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sattvik.clojure_repl">Clojure REPL</a> and the
local instance of the 4Clojure problems were held on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bytopia.foreclojure">4Clojure app</a>. Both
apps are pretty nifty. The only thing that slowed me down was trying to type all
those parens on the native keyboard.</p>

<p>4Clojure is good resource of problems to help learn Clojure; I&rsquo;ve been getting
rusty recently as my main focus has been JavaScript. And planning my wedding.</p>

<p>For the record, this is the function I wrote:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">(fn flatn [lst]
  (if (coll? lst)
    (apply concat (map flatn lst))
    [lst]))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this was done at the north end of the Victoria line, near Finsbury
Park. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have managed it on the Northern line in the City&hellip;</p>
