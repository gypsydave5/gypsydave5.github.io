  <h1>Lambda Calculus 1 - Syntax</h1>
  <time datetime="2017-09-11T20:54" >Sep 11, 2017</time>
  <p>The word &lsquo;lambda&rsquo; comes up more and more the longer you work as a
programmer. There it is as a keyword in Python for an anonymous function. Same
again in Scheme. Oh look, there it is in Ruby. Look at the logos for Racket,
Clojure, MIT. Lambdas everywhere. The interest/obsession goes back to the
mathematical roots of Lisp, specifically Alonzo Church&rsquo;s <em>lambda calculus</em>.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Church was researching the foundations of mathematics - particularly
computation. The notation he came up with is a way of expressing any computation
at all - if a computer can do it, it can be written in the syntax of the lambda
calculus. But, interestingly for us, it is not concerned about <em>how</em> he
computer does it; rather it just has some simple rules about <em>what</em> a
computer can do. It is, if you like, a very simple declarative programming
language.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The lambda calculus gets its name from its use of the Greek letter lambda -
$\lambda$ to represent a function that takes a single argument.</p>

<p>After the $\lambda$ comes the name that that single argument is bound to - say $x$.</p>

<p>And after that we write a $.$ to say that we&rsquo;re inside the &lsquo;body&rsquo; of the function.</p>

<p>The $x$ is a bound variable - it stands for some value that the function can be
applied to.</p>

<p>And to apply a value to a function, you call it by putting them next to each
other (maybe with some brackets to make it clearer what&rsquo;s the value and what&rsquo;s
the body).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s everything in the lambda calculus - it&rsquo;s a syntax for writing
about functions of one argument.</p>

<p>So where in JavaScript we have:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">x =&gt; x + 1
</code></pre>

<p>and in Scheme we have</p>

<pre><code class="language-scheme">(lambda (x) (+ x 1))
</code></pre>

<p>in the lambda calculus syntax we have:</p>

<p>$$ \lambda x.x + 1 $$</p>

<h2>Only one argument?</h2>

<p>So you might see some limitations here.Only one argument, you may say, what
if I need another one? Happily we can just return another function to bind a new
argument. Hooray - everything is <a href="/posts/2015/2/19/%28not-quite%29-currying-in-javascript/">curryed</a>.</p>

<p>So where in JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">x =&gt; y =&gt; x + y
</code></pre>

<p>and in Scheme:</p>

<pre><code class="language-scheme">(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (+ x y)))
</code></pre>

<p>so in the lambda calculus we have:</p>

<p>$$ \lambda x.\lambda y.x + y $$</p>

<p>Although usually<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> we&rsquo;d just write:</p>

<p>$$ \lambda xy.x + y $$</p>

<p>But we would of course remember that, if the function had only one argument
applied to it, it would return a function that expected the next argument.</p>

<h2>$\alpha$-conversion, $\beta$-reduction</h2>

<p>These terms do absolutely nothing to dispell the feeling that the lambda
calculus is a bit elitist. Look, even more Greek letters - it must be
complicated and clever because just writing about it requires me to know how to
say $\alpha$!</p>

<p>Really though, these are just big words for &lsquo;substitution&rsquo; and &lsquo;application&rsquo;,
the basics of which you probably picked up in high school algebra.</p>

<p>&lsquo;α-conversion&rsquo; (alpha-conversion) just means that we can change the name of a
bound variable in a Lambda expression. So if we&rsquo;ve got:</p>

<p>$$ \lambda xy.x + y $$</p>

<p>We can just change all the $x$s to $a$s</p>

<p>$$ \lambda ay.a + y $$</p>

<p>And the expression hasn&rsquo;t changed its meaning one iota.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>&lsquo;β-reduction&rsquo; (beta-reduction) is a little more complicated - what it means is
that, when a value is applied to a function, we can substitute all the variables
that name that argument with the value the function is applied to. For instance,
in JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">(x =&gt; y =&gt; x + y)(5)
</code></pre>

<p>under β-reduction becomes</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">y =&gt; 5 + y
</code></pre>

<p>We unwrap the outer function and replace occurances of its variable with the
supplied value. In lambda land:</p>

<p>$$ (\lambda xy. x + y)\ 5 $$</p>

<p>Becomes</p>

<p>$$ \lambda y. 5 + y $$</p>

<p>(I threw some parentheses around that other Lambda expression to make it clear
that the $5$ was getting applied to the whole function and to separate it from
the body $x + y$ - there&rsquo;s no hard and fast rules as far as that goes).</p>
