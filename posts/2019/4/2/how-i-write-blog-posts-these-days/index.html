  <h1>How I Write Blog Posts These Days</h1>
  <time datetime="2019-04-02T21:26" >Apr 02, 2019</time>
  <h2>1. Editor: Vim</h2>

<p>I write my Markdown in Vim. Or Emacs in Evil mode, which is Vim emulation in
Emacs. Why? Well, I find the manipulation of text - any text - really quick and
easy in Vim. Moving paragraphs, changing words, deleting sentences - Vim is
aware of the structure of natural language, which makes using it to edit blog
posts quite easy.</p>

<h2>2. Format: Markdown</h2>

<p>Markdown is both wonderful and terrible. Wonderful as it&rsquo;s <em>everywhere</em>, is
human readable, and supports the structures you want to use for technical
writing - i.e. code blocks. Terrible because there is no standard and so the
HTML you&rsquo;ll get out of the other end of a parser is not consistent between
parsers.</p>

<p>Think this isn&rsquo;t too much trouble? I have to join all the lines in a paragraph
to a single line when I&rsquo;m posting on Dev.to as the Markdown parser treats all
the line breaks in a paragraph as hard breaks.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s this inconsistency in Markdown parsers that makes me avoid (or at least not
rely on) Markdown linters and previewers in my editors. I tend to wait until the
post is near finished before I see what it looks like with stage 5 (see below).</p>

<p>Still, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and so Markdown it is.</p>

<h3>3. Grammar and Spelling: aspell, style and diction</h3>

<p>Markdown posts like this can be sent to <a href="http://aspell.net/"><code>aspell</code></a>, a handy
interactive and extensible spellchecker. Good editor integration for aspell
exists in both Vim and Emacs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diction/diction.html"><code>style</code> and <code>diction</code></a> are
a pair of tools that check for grammar mistakes and readability. <code>diction</code> picks
up on clich√©s, doubled-words and potential misspellings. It&rsquo;s <em>sometimes</em> wrong
but it gets you thinking about whether you could word things better and so makes
an excellent starting point.</p>

<p><code>style</code> describes how readable your document is through a series of scores
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests">Flesch-Kinkaid</a>
for instance. It&rsquo;s interesting information.</p>

<h3>4. Storage: GitHub</h3>

<p>I keep my posts <a href="https://github.com/gypsydave5/gypsydave5.github.io">on GitHub</a>.
If someone spots a mistake in what I&rsquo;ve written then at least this way they can
open a pull request.</p>

<h3>5. My Site: Static Site + GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host my blog as
a static site since forever. It&rsquo;s an easy enough hosting solution and you can
use it with any number of static site generators to turn your Markdown into
HTML.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/gypsydave5/blawg">my own static site generator</a>
because I found every one I tried a little too busy for my liking. It&rsquo;s <em>still</em>
too busy for my liking and I reckon it could be scrapped in favour of
<a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> and a few glue scripts, but it was fun to write.
I wouldn&rsquo;t use it if I were you.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/gypsydave5/gypsydave5.github.io/blob/source/publish.sh">horrible bash
script</a>
to publish the blog, and it looks <a href="http://blog.gypsydave5.com/">like this</a> when
it&rsquo;s published.</p>
