I finished the [Ruby Koans](https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans) today. I'd been
pretty close to the end before I started study at Makers Academy, but it's good
to have them done. I noticed I flew through the last few regardng
metaprogramming - I've been taught well.

Koans are an interesting tool to learn a language. Instead of teaching a fact,
they instead encourage solving a problem. The problems are koans in the sense
that the solution to each one reveals a new aspect of Ruby to the student. This
starts with simple operators and ends with metaprogramming techniques. The
solution tends to be of the 'fill in the blank' form, although sometimes they
require editing a class.

What I admire about this technique is the following:

- Each problem is, in effect, a test. TDD is baked in from the beginning, even
  if you don't happen to know what testing is. Think of it as test driven
  learning.

- The lessons are inseperable from the questions. Simply by answering the
  question you are learning. There is no text with a list of questions at the
  end to ensure understanding.

- Hands on keyboard. You're reading, and writing, code in an active way. There
  is no passive learning with writing koans.

If you've not tried out a set of koans, here's <del>a short</del> <ins>an incresingly
long</ins> list to try out:

I've started the [Clojure Koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans).
Where the Ruby Koans were verbose, these are terse.  I like terse. Very often
I felt like I was being told what to write as the answer to the Ruby Koans. That
was right for Ruby, but not for Clojure.

So - go learn something new today!
