Adding to my list of [ways to fix the Windows experience][SurvWin], I have to
pay due respect to [Krystoff Kowalcyzk][KK], a developer who
has ported [Ag (aka The Silver Surfer)][AG] over to Windows. He's also authored
a really elegant (and for elegant please read lightweight and customizable)
PDF viewer [SumatraPDF][SPDF]. Both of these have improved my life today.

I've been looking at alternatives to Adobe Reader on the Ubuntu box as well -
currently I'm enjoying the simplicity of [muPDF][muPDF], but there are many
other options out there.
