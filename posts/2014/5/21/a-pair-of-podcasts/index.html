  <h1>A Pair of Podcasts</h1>
  <time datetime="2014-05-21T22:06" >May 21, 2014</time>
  <p>Trying to bootstrap myself into software development is a struggle. A struggle
with some successes - I mean, let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that I&rsquo;m writing this in
markdown using vim using jekyll to create a static site that&amp;rsquo;s being
hosted with GitHub Pages; a few months ago I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have known what that
meant. But a struggle none the less.</p>

<p>I&amp;rsquo;ve always found immersion to be key to being able to get my head around
a subject - just hammering away until it starts to make sense. A great help in
all of this has been a pair of fantastic podcasts from Envylabs, <a href="http://five-js.envylabs.com/"><em>Five Minutes
of JavaScript</em></a> and <a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com/"><em>Ruby 5</em></a> (it was only when I came to Google
&amp;ldquo;JavaScript 5&amp;rdquo; that it became clear why they went with the
convoluted title&hellip;).</p>

<p>Both podcasts are short - seven minutes max - and just list down anything
that&amp;rsquo;s going on with the two languages at the moment. They&amp;rsquo;re
broadcast twice weekly, keeping the information fresh and pertinent. At first
I had very little idea what was going on - technologies I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of
doing things I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand, updates, new &lsquo;gems&rsquo;&hellip; all a bit of
a mystery.</p>

<p>But the short format, and regular broadcasts, encouraged listening. I can catch
up in five minutes when waiting for a train, walking the dog, popping to the
shops. And it&amp;rsquo;s started to pay off; I now understand about 70% of what&rsquo;s
going on in each episode, and I&rsquo;m using the technologies they talk about (like
jekyll).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried other podcasts and audios - chiefly lecture series from some of
America&rsquo;s great institutions such as Harvard&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.U30fhR_Hk8o">CS50</a> course available
from <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.U30fhR_Hk8o">EdX</a>, and Stanford&rsquo;s <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111">Programming Methodology</a> course
(which I enjoy a lot). While these broad academic courses are both informative
and entertaining, and helpful, I&rsquo;m still not at the point where the subjects
under discussion are anything more than reinforcement to my study of Ruby and
JavaScript. I&rsquo;m sure it will also click into place eventually, much like the
Envylabs podcasts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning the player I&rsquo;m using too - <a href="https://player.fm/">Player FM</a> is maybe
the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever used to play a podcast. Does everything you want, does
nothing you don&rsquo;t and sits on the phone occasionally telling you when there&rsquo;s
a new episode.</p>
