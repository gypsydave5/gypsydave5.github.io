title: About
---

I'm a graduate of [the University of Warwick] and [Makers Academy]. I have been
an academic philosopher, a copy writer, a proof reader,
a digital marketeer and I've worked on a library van. I'm now a
software developer (and it still feels weird saying that).

I try to write good code and then I try to write better code, and I want to test
everything. I like [software craftsmanship], [XP], functional programming, chess
and tea. I believe I'm getting better everyday at everything I do, and that
I will never stop feeling stupid and excited.
