<p>
Just been looking at <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a>
again in preparation for my forthcoming interview with
<a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Makers Academy</a> (because it's never too
late and you can always do more).
</p>

<p>
It strikes me what a difference a few months of Ruby and a course
redesign makes. Now when faced with the first set of exercises I wasn't,
as before, struggling to keep up and make sense. Instead I was
interrogating what was going on - "Wait, <code>Zombie.find(1)</code> - what's it
finding? Capital Z&#x2026; is it a class? Let's find out
<code>Zombie.class =&gt; Class</code> - cool, so the tables are represented by
different classes in Ruby&#x2026; what sort of methods does a Zombie have
anyway? <code>Zombie.find(1).methods</code>&#x2026;" and so on.
</p>

<p>
This was great - using the techniques I'd picked up from Ruby Monk and
Ruby Koans to work out for myself what was going on (and not have an
instructor tell me). By the end of the course (and the first part of the
sequel) I had suddenly gained an insight not only into what Rails can
do, but how it does it, and why it does it the way it does. I could also
see what MVC was, not just as a theory but literally in the code - this
is the controller, this is a model.
</p>

<p>
The guys at <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Codeschool</a> have changed the
course since my first attempt at it &#x2014; they describe it as Rails for
Zombies: Redux &#x2014; and it's a huge improvement. Definitely worth a look.
And it's FREE!
