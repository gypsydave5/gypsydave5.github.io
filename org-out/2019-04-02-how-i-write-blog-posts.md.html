<p>
I write my Markdown in Vim. Or Emacs in Evil mode, which is Vim
emulation in Emacs. Why? Well, I find the manipulation of text - any
text - really quick and easy in Vim. Moving paragraphs, changing words,
deleting sentences - Vim is aware of the structure of natural language,
which makes using it to edit blog posts quite easy.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-format-markdown">
<p>
Markdown is both wonderful and terrible. Wonderful as it's <i>everywhere</i>,
is human readable, and supports the structures you want to use for
technical writing - i.e. code blocks. Terrible because there is no
standard and so the HTML you'll get out of the other end of a parser is
not consistent between parsers.
</p>

<p>
Think this isn't too much trouble? I have to join all the lines in a
paragraph to a single line when I'm posting on Dev.to as the Markdown
parser treats all the line breaks in a paragraph as hard breaks.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
It's this inconsistency in Markdown parsers that makes me avoid (or at
least not rely on) Markdown linters and previewers in my editors. I tend
to wait until the post is near finished before I see what it looks like
with stage 5 (see below).
</p>

<p>
Still, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and so Markdown it is.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-grammar-and-spelling-aspell-style-and-diction">
<p>
Markdown posts like this can be sent to
<a href="http://aspell.net/"><code>aspell</code></a>, a handy interactive and extensible
spellchecker. Good editor integration for aspell exists in both Vim and
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diction/diction.html"><code>style</code> and
<code>diction</code></a> are a pair of tools that check for grammar mistakes and
readability. <code>diction</code> picks up on clichés, doubled-words and potential
misspellings. It's <i>sometimes</i> wrong but it gets you thinking about
whether you could word things better and so makes an excellent starting
point.
</p>

<p>
<code>style</code> describes how readable your document is through a series of
scores -
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests">Flesch-Kinkaid</a>
for instance. It's interesting information.

I keep my posts <a href="https://github.com/gypsydave5/gypsydave5.github.io">on
GitHub</a>. If someone spots a mistake in what I've written then at least
this way they can open a pull request.

<p>
I've been using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host my
blog as a static site since forever. It's an easy enough hosting
solution and you can use it with any number of static site generators to
turn your Markdown into HTML.
</p>

<p>
I wrote <a href="https://github.com/gypsydave5/blawg">my own static site
generator</a> because I found every one I tried a little too busy for my
liking. It's <i>still</i> too busy for my liking and I reckon it could be
scrapped in favour of <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> and a few glue
scripts, but it was fun to write. I wouldn't use it if I were you.
</p>

<p>
I have a
<a href="https://github.com/gypsydave5/gypsydave5.github.io/blob/source/publish.sh">horrible
bash script</a> to publish the blog, and it looks
<a href="http://blog.gypsydave5.com/">like this</a> when it's published.
