<p>
Previously I've posted about
<a href="file:///posts/2017/9/11/lambda-calculus-1---syntax/">the lambda calculus</a>
and <a href="file:///posts/2017/9/13/lambda-calculus-2---church-numbers/">Church
numbers</a>. We'd shown how we can encode numbers as functions using the
Church encoding, but we'd not really shown how we could <i>do</i> anything
with those numbers.
</p>

<p>
But before we get into it, let's clear up some stuff about brackets&#x2026;
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb4b1400" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="left-association-and-you">Left association and you</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-left-association-and-you">
<p>
Just as it's easier to write $&lambda; nfx.$ than
$&lambda; n.&lambda; f.&lambda; x.$ because we make the assumption that
each application of the function returns a new function, so there is a
way of writing out function application without having to use lots of
parentheses.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Where we would normally write
</p>

<p>
\[
f(x)
\]
</p>

<p>
with parentheses, we could instead write
</p>

<p>
\[
f\ x
\]
</p>

<p>
under the assumption that each argument associates to the one on the
left. So if we had
</p>

<p>
\[
((f(x)\ y)\ z)
\]
</p>

<p>
we can write it as
</p>

<p>
\[
f\ x\ y\ z
\]
</p>

<p>
and something like
</p>

<p>
\[
(g(x)\ f(x))
\]
</p>

<p>
is
</p>

<p>
\[
g\ x\ (f\ x)
\]
</p>

<p>
As we still need the parentheses to make sure that the \(f\) and \(x\) get
bundled together. We'll need this convention as we go on as things are
going to get a little more parenthesis-heavy.

<p>
OK, let's get back to the arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Say we have the number three:
</p>

<p>
\[
three \ \equiv \ \lambda f \lambda x.\ f\ (f\ (f x))
\]
</p>

<p>
(the function \(f\) applied to \(x\) three times)
</p>

<p>
And we wanted to get to the number four:
</p>

<p>
\[
four \ \equiv \ \lambda f \lambda x.\ f\ (f \(f\ (f x)))
\]
</p>

<p>
(the function \(f\) applied to \(x\) four times)
</p>

<p>
How do we get from \(three\) to \(four\)? Well, the difference is that we
just need to apply \(f\) one more time.
</p>

<p>
\[
four \ \equiv \ f\ three
\]
</p>

<p>
We can encode the idea of applying \(f\) one more time into a lambda
function. We could call it \(add-one\) or \(increment\) but lets go with
\(succ\) for 'successor'.
</p>

<p>
\[
succ \ \equiv \ \lambda n. \lambda f. \lambda x.\ f\ (n\ f\ x)
\]
</p>

<p>
The \(n\) is the number we're adding one to - we need to bind in the
values of \(f\) and \(x\) in to the function because they'll need to have
\(n\) applied to them before we can apply \(f\) in the one extra time.
</p>

<p>
Another way to think of this is that the general signature for a number
is $&lambda; f. &lambda; x.$, and that when we apply \(succ\) to a number,
we need to get back another number - something else with the signature
of $&lambda; f. &lambda;\ x.$
</p>

<p>
So the signature of \(succ\) - and consequently any unary operation on a
number - is \(\lambda n.\lambda f.\lambda x\), where \(n\) is the number
being changed.
</p>

<p>
In Clojure that looks like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">fn</span> [n] (<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">fn</span> [f] (<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">fn</span> [x] (f ((n f) x))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Yeah, it's a bit <i>verbose</i> in comparison to the lambda calculus
version.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> All those parentheses, while great for being explicit
about which functions get applied to what, makes it a bit tough on the
eyes.
</p>

<p>
What about Haskell?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">\n f x -&gt; f (n f x)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Bit more like the original, eh? Haskell has currying and
left-association baked in to its syntax so its lambda expressions look
almost exactly the same as the lambda calculus ones. You can see why
it's so popular.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7dd635f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="addition">Addition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-addition">
<p>
Let's see if we can define addition.
</p>

<p>
First off, \(addition\) is an operation that takes two arguments, two
numbers. So we know it needs to look something like:
</p>

<p>
\[
\lambda m. \lambda n. \lambda f. \lambda x.
\]
</p>

<p>
Where \(m\) and \(n\) are the numbers being added together. Now all we need
to do is work out what comes after the dot.
</p>

<p>
We could define it in terms of \(succ\) - all we need to do is apply
\(succ\) \(m\) many times to \(n\):
</p>

<p>
\[
\lambda m.\lambda n.\lambda f.\lambda x.\ m\ succ\ n\ f\ x
\]
</p>

<p>
And this works,<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> but we could probably write something both more
intuitive and simpler.
</p>

<p>
What do we want as the result of \(add\)? We want a function that applies
\(f\) to \(x\) \(n\) many times, and the applies \(f\) to the result of that \(m\)
many times.
</p>

<p>
\[
add\ (\lambda fx.\ f\ (f\ x))\ (\lambda fx.\ f\ (f\ (f\ x))) = \lambda fx.\ f\ (f\ (f\ (f\ (f\ x))))
\]
</p>

<p>
We can just write that out with the variables we've been given - first
apply \(f\) to \(x\), \(n\) many times.
</p>

<p>
\[
n\ f\ x
\]
</p>

<p>
and then apply \(f\) to that result \(m\) many times
</p>

<p>
\[
m\ f\ (n\ f\ x)
\]
</p>

<p>
giving us
</p>

<p>
\[
add\ \equiv\ \lambda n.\lambda m.\lambda f.\lambda x.\ m\ f\ (n\ f\ x)
\]
</p>

<p>
The order of \(n\) and \(m\) doesn't matter as they're just the order in
which the number of $f$s are applied.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6fa2dd0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="multiplication">Multiplication</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-multiplication">
<p>
We've used the word 'times' a lot here when talking about the
application of \(f\) onto $x$s in the above. But now we'll have to deal
with real multiplication.
</p>

<p>
Before you try and reach at an answer, step back a little and ask
yourself what the result ought to be, and what the Church arithmetic way
of describing it would be.
</p>

<p>
Say we had the numbers two and three. If I was back in primary school
I'd say that the reason that multiplying them together made six was
because six was 'two lots of three' or 'three lots of two'.
</p>

<p>
So when I want to put this into Church arithmetic, I feel like saying
'six is the application of three lots of the application of two lots of
the application of \(f\) onto \(x\)'. Which is a mouthful, for sure, but
looks like
</p>

<p>
\[
six\ \equiv\ \lambda f.\lambda x.\ ((three\ (two\ f))\ x)
\]
</p>

<p>
or, without the parentheses
</p>

<p>
\[
six\ \equiv\ \lambda f.\lambda x.\ three\ (two\ f)\ x
\]
</p>

<p>
\(two\ f\) is a function that applies \(f\) two times to whatever it's next
argument is. \(three\ (two\ f)\) will apply \(two\ f\) to its next argument
three times. So it will apply it \(3\ \times\ 2\) times - 6 times.
</p>

<p>
And so now we can move from the particular case to the general case;
multiplication is:
</p>

<p>
\[
mult\ \equiv\ \lambda m.\lambda n.\lambda f.\lambda x.\ m\ (n\ f)\ x
\]
</p>

<p>
"\(m\) lots of (\(n\) lots of \(f\)) applied to \(x\)", which is still a
mouthful but
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1809e58" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="exponentiation">Exponentiation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-exponentiation">
<p>
So what could exponentiation be? Well, the first thing we know is that
this time, order <i>is</i> going to be important - \(2^3\) is not the same as
\(3^2\).
</p>

<p>
Next, what does exponentiation <i>mean</i>? I mean, really mean? When we did
multiplication we saw us doing 'two lots of (three lots of \(f\))'. But
now we need to do 'two lots of something' three times. The 'three' part
has to apply, not to the number of times we do an \(f\), nor the number of
times we do '\(n\) lots of \(f\)'. But rather it needs to be <i>the number of
times we do \(n\) to itself</i>.
</p>

<p>
Woah.
</p>

<p>
So if 'three' is the application of \(f\) three times to \(x\), we can say
that \(2^3\) is the application of \(two\) three times to \(f\ x\).
</p>

<p>
Even. Bigger. Woah.
</p>

<p>
Another way to look at it: a Church number is already encoding some of
the behaviour of exponentiation. When we use <code>inc</code> and <code>0</code> as <code>f</code> and
<code>x</code> we can think of the number <code>n</code> acting as \(inc^n\) - <code>inc</code> done to
itself <code>n</code> many times.
</p>

<p>
This is more explicit if we try it with something other than increment -
say <code>double</code>, aka 'times two'. Let's do it in Haskell - but please feel
free to pick any language you like.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">let timesTwo = \x -&gt; 2 * x
let four = \f x -&gt; f(f(f(f x)))

four timesTwo 1 -- 16
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Four lots of <code>timesTwo</code> is 16; all we need to do is to use the number
two instead, and apply the result to an <code>f</code> and an <code>x</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">let two = \f x -&gt; f(f x)
four two succ 0 -- 16
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Sixteen again.
</p>

<p>
So function for exponentiation - <code>m</code> to the power of <code>n</code> - is:
</p>

<p>
\[
exp\ \equiv\ \lambda m.\lambda n.\lambda f.\lambda x.\ n\ m\ f\ x
\]
</p>

<p>
But remember $&eta;$-reduction? We can just go directly to:
</p>

<p>
\[
exp\ \equiv\ \lambda m.\lambda n.\ n\ m
\]
</p>

<p>
This is because you know the function you're left with after you've
applied \(n\) to \(m\) is a number - will take an \(f\) and an \(x\) - you don't
need to explicitly bind them in the outer function just in order to pass
them unchanged to the inner one.
</p>

<p>
But that's just a nicety. The important thing is&#x2026; we've finished!

This post looked at some simple arithmetic using Church numerals. We saw
successor
</p>

<p>
\[
succ\quad \equiv\quad \lambda n.\lambda f.\lambda x.\ f\ (n\ f\ x)
\]
</p>

<p>
addition:
</p>

<p>
\[
add\quad \equiv\quad \lambda m.\lambda n.\lambda f.\lambda x.\ m\ f\ (n\ f\ x)
\]
</p>

<p>
multiplication:
</p>

<p>
\[
mult\quad \equiv\quad \lambda m.\lambda n.\lambda f.\lambda x.\ m\ (n\ f)\ x
\]
</p>

<p>
and exponentiation:
</p>

<p>
\[
exp\quad \equiv\quad \lambda m.\lambda n.\ m\ n
\]
</p>

<p>
An interesting relationship between the last three: the \(f\) moves along
to the right as the operation becomes 'bigger'.
</p>

<p>
Next post we'll be taking a short break from arithmetic to take a look
at logic using the lambda calculus.
