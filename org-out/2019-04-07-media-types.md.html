<p>
Media types are used to communicate the type of data being sent over the
web. They are used
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in an HTTP response to declare the type of content being sent</li>
<li>in requests to declare what sort of content the client can interpret</li>
<li>in POST requests to declare the type of content being sent.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Basically, wherever there is data on the web, there will be a media type
to tell you what sort of data it is. And if there's not, well there
really ought to be.
</p>

<p>
This article will explain how to interpret a media type and also explain
how they are used in HTTP headers to make sure we get the data that we
can understand.

<h2 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-who-is-this-for">
<p>
This is for web developers who are interested in understanding how to
move data over the web. Some knowledge of HTTP, specifically headers, is
useful but not necessary.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5a745a7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="where-have-i-seen-media-types-before">Where Have I Seen Media Types Before?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-where-have-i-seen-media-types-before">
<p>
The first time I saw a media type was when I wrote my first HTML file -
specifically to get some CSS:<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" src="style.css" type="text/css" /&gt;
</pre>

<p>
There's our first media type - <code>text/css</code>.
</p>

<p>
The next place I bumped into them was when I was returning JSON from a
server:
</p>

<pre class="example">
response.contentType = "application/json"
</pre>

<p>
There's another one - <code>application/json</code>.
</p>

<p>
So they're not completely alien to us - they're a way of saying that
"the file is full of CSS", and "I'm sending you some JSON". Let's take a
closer look at these two types while investigating the syntax of media
types.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc20ae24" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="media-type-syntax">Media Type Syntax</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-media-type-syntax">
<p>
A media type is made up of two fields separated by a <code>/</code>. The first is
the <code>type</code> and the second is the <code>subtype</code>.
</p>

<p>
Straight off we can see that CSS (<code>text/css</code>) has a type of <code>text</code>, and
a subtype of <code>css</code>. The <code>text</code> type is very broad - it says that the
media is just text, which covers quite a few types of content - content
such as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>text/html</code> - it's what you're reading right now!</li>
<li><code>text/plain</code> - it's just plain text!</li>
<li><code>text/markdown</code> - what I'm writing this in which will get turned into
<code>text/html</code></li>
<li><code>text/csv</code> &#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
you get the idea.
</p>

<p>
<code>application/json</code> has a subtype of <code>json</code>, which is appropriate as,
well, it <i>is</i> JSON. The <code>application</code> type informs us that this is a
type that's meant to be processed by a application. This kinda makes
sense, as it's JSON, which is meant to be read by computers.
</p>

<p>
(But isn't CSS only meant to be processed by an application? Yes, it is.
Maybe it should have been <code>application/css</code>. Maybe it should have been
<code>text/json</code>. Who knows. Media types are a bit wonky. The whole web is a
bit wonky. Don't worry about it too much. Part of being a web developer
is learning to live with a fair amount of kludge and ambiguity that
happened before some of us were born. Learn to live with it.)
</p>

<p>
Other fun <code>application</code> types are
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>application/pdf</code> for PDFs</li>
<li><code>application/zip</code> for zip files</li>
<li>and many, many more&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

you're likely to come across with examples:

<p>
Type and subtype are the only parts of a media type that are required,
but there are also couple of optional parts.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5b892cb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-parameters">
<p>
Media types can have a list of parameters tagged on to them after a
semicolon. For instance
</p>

<pre class="example">
text/plain;charset=UTF-8
</pre>

<p>
is a <code>text/plain</code> media type that's using the UTF-8 character encoding.
If we want our sweet emojis to work we need to remember to say we're
using UTF-8, or else the client will assume we're writing in ASCII like
1970s cavemen.
</p>

<p>
Parameter types aren't dictated by the media type specification,<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
and you can have as many of them as you like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
text/plain;charset=UTF-8,blog-post=true,author=gypsydave5
</pre>

<p>
They gain their meaning through context; browsers, for instance, will
look for and use a <code>charset</code> parameter when they read a media type over
HTTP. More on browsers in a bit.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2a9c67c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="structured-syntax-name-suffix">Structured Syntax Name Suffix</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-structured-syntax-name-suffix">
<p>
This one's a bit weird, but it's also cool, so bear with me. Take a look
at this media type:
</p>

<pre class="example">
image/svg+xml
</pre>

<p>
This is the type for SVG images - Scalable Vector Graphics. <code>image</code> is
the type, <code>svg</code> is the subtype - that's what we'd expect.
</p>

<p>
But what's this <code>+xml</code> doing at the end? Well, as you may already know,
SVGs are written in XML - it's one of the nicest things about them. So
the <code>+xml</code> is telling us that the syntax of SVG is XML; you could say
that XML is the 'base' language for SVG. This is called the 'structured
syntax name', and it's a nice way of letting us know that, hey, you may
not know what SVGs are but, it's OK, it's just XML under the hood so
you'll be fine.
</p>

<p>
(Unless you're me and you panic everytime you hear the word XML and you
find it ridiculous that some people think it's human readable and you
wish that the whole world was represented as JSON, but that's another
story&#x2026;)
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Look, I can tell you're really excited by all these media types. Now you
know how to understand them, you can read the
<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">list
of all the media types</a> that have been registered with IANA, the
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. Go on, read them all now. I'll
wait.
</p>

<p>
There's a lot, right? Try not to panic - you'll probably only ever use
ten of them at most. But did you see the one for SNES ROMs?

<div id="outline-container-org883213b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="media-types-in-http-message-headers">Media Types in HTTP Message Headers</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-media-types-in-http-message-headers">
<p>
The most important place you'll use media types is in HTTP messages.
You'll use them to describe the media type of the data you want in the
<code>Accept</code> header of an HTTP Request, and the type of data you're sending
in the <code>Content-Type</code> header of an HTTP Response.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org01d32cf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="the-accept-header">The <code>Accept</code> Header</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-the-accept-header">
<p>
The <code>Accept</code> header is the way a client - like your browser - can tell a
server what sort of content it wants.
</p>

<p>
At its simplest it can look like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Accept: application/json
</pre>

<p>
If I put this in the header of my request, I'd be making it very clear
to the server that I want JSON back. No questions asked.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
But say you wanted some audio back from the server, but didn't mind what
subtype - <code>audio/mp3</code> is just as good as <code>audio/wav</code> for you. In this
case you can say:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Accept: audio/*
</pre>

<p>
<code>*</code> represents a wildcard - it means 'give me anything'. The server
could legitimately reply with an <code>audio</code> media type with <i>any</i> subtype.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you just don't care what comes back from the server you can
just say
</p>

<pre class="example">
Accept: */*
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga7894ff" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="the-content-type-header">The <code>Content-Type</code> Header</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-the-content-type-header">
<p>
<code>Content-Type</code> is the header you should add to an HTTP Response message
to tell the client what they're getting in the response body. This is
how the client knows how to interpret the message that you're sending.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Content-Type</code> header should have one media type, so it could be as
simple as this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Content-Type: text/html
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8f02549" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="wait-cant-i-just-use-a-file-extension">Wait, can't I just use a file extension?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-wait-cant-i-just-use-a-file-extension">
<p>
You can imagine that you've got some data that you can get to through a
URL:
</p>

<pre class="example">
http://gypsydave5/data
</pre>

<p>
Maybe if I wanted to get the data as JSON I could request:
</p>

<pre class="example">
http://gypsydave5/data.json
</pre>

<p>
But if I want XML instead I could do:
</p>

<pre class="example">
http://gypsydave5/data.xml
</pre>

<p>
The benefit being that this is pretty easy to understand if I'm used to
using a filesystem - I can just identify the type of file by the
extension, and so I can now do the same with a URL.
</p>

<p>
What's the harm? Probably the most annoying thing is that, even if you
provide an extension as above, you'll <i>still</i> have to provide a
<code>Content-Type</code> header. This is because, on the web, information about
content isn't meant to be encoded in URLs; it's meant to be in the
<code>Content-Type</code> header.
</p>

<p>
Some popular frameworks do this,<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> but it's a bad idea. Don't do it.
</p>

<p>
The biggest problem is that you'll miss out on being able to perform
<i>content negotiation</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2c554e6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="content-negotiation">Content Negotiation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-content-negotiation">
<p>
Pretend you're going to a sandwich shop and your friend asks you to get
a sandwich. Sure, you say, what do you want? I don't know, they say,
what do they have? Um&#x2026; you say, I really don't know - here's the menu
but they've often run out of some of the fillings by this time of day.
</p>

<p>
OK, says your friend, here's what I'd like:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"I want tuna mayo or a New Yorker - either is fine. If they don't have
those, then I'll take an egg salad. And if they don't have an egg
salad, then please, get me anything - I'm starving."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Doesn't sound too bad. You can use your friend's set of sandwich
requirements when you get to the sandwich shop to get them a sandwich
that they'll like.
</p>

<p>
The same thing happens every day on the web, with clients sending a list
of media types over to servers to try and make sure that they'll get
something they like. Take a look at this <code>Accept</code> header of an HTTP
Request sent from a web browser:<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<pre class="example">
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
</pre>

<p>
The browser wants one of the above media types. But it's got some
opinions about which ones it would prefer, which it's expressing using
<code>q</code> parameters.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> <code>q</code> parameters have a value between <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>,
and the default value of a <code>q</code> parameter (when it's not supplied) is
<code>1</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here's the media types above written out with their <code>q</code> values.
</p>

<table>


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left">

<col  class="org-right">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">media type</th>

<td class="org-right">0.9</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left"><code>*/*</code></td>
<td class="org-right">0.8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
A series of choices ranked by preference. If you or I were going to the
server to get the browser some content, the browser would tell us
something like:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"I really want <code>text/html</code> and <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. But, if they
don't have those, I'd go for some sweet <code>application/xml</code>. And if they
don't have that then, whatever, just get me anything."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Which is really what you'd want a browser to do - you always want to get
<i>something</i> back.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Accept: audio/*
</pre>

<p>
Is like we're being sent to the record store:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Could you get me the new Nirvana album?<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> I don't care if it's on
vinyl, tape or CD. Hell, 8 Track will do. Just make sure I can listen
to it, OK - I don't just want the poster."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is <i>content negotiation</i> - our request to the server has given it
our preferences regarding the content type we get back. It can go
through those prefences, looking at what content types it can return,
and give us the type that matches the most closely.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0c8665f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="content-negotiation-and-testing">Content Negotiation and Testing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-content-negotiation-and-testing">
<p>
It's easier to write tests on the data that builds an HTML page than the
HTML itself. If you build your application with content negotiation, you
can test the contents of a 'page' by requesting the JSON representation
rather than the HTML representation.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="roll-your-own-media-type">Roll your own media type</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-roll-your-own-media-type">
<p>
You can invent your own media types, and it's not as rare as you might
think. In fact it's a powerful technique for writing web APIs. The media
type specification has space for subtypes that aren't registered (and
should never be registered). They start with <code>x-</code>:<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>
</p>

<pre class="example">
application/x-myapplication-orderstatus+json
</pre>

<p>
This could be the media type for the order status in my application.
<code>+json</code> lets everyone know that it's written in JSON, but we've tightly
specified that the content is a part of <code>myapplication</code> - it's not just
any old JSON.
</p>

<p>
This is just vanity if you don't choose to leverage it to pass on
additional information about the media type. For instance, if you want
to change the structure of the
<code>application/x-myapplication-orderstatus+json</code> media type, you can add a
version parameter:<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>
</p>

<pre class="example">
application/x-myapplication-orderstatus+json;v=1.1
</pre>

<p>
This is very useful when describing the content types that are sent and
received across an evolving REST API.
</p>

<p>
Finally you can <a href="https://www.iana.org/form/media-types">register your
media type with IANA</a> to let the world know how to interact with your
application.

No, I don't. MIME means <i>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions</i> and was

'media type'. People still tend to use MIME, media and content type
