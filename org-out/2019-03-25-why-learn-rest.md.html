<p>
This is for&#x2026; me! I've been working for however many years and still
don't know how REST is meant to work. You may think REST is about making
sure you use POST for a new 'thing' rather than 'PUT', and 'DELETE' to
remove a 'thing' unless it's from a browser. This is pretty much my
position up to a few days ago.
</p>

<p>
REST is a lot more interesting, and relies on some truly beautiful
abstractions.
</p>
</div>

<p>
REST is a model of distributed computing built upon the World Wide Web.
So if we're going to understand REST we're going to need a grasp on how
the Web works. Don't worry, this isn't goind to be the low-level
details - we're not going to be talking about the intricacies of TCP/IP
architecture or what an HTTP message looks like. This isn't technical -
if anything it's harder: it's abstract.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdadbab0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning&#x2026;</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-in-the-beginning">
<p>
When the Web was built there were no abstractions; it was very simple. A
Uniform Resource Locator (URL<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>) pointed to a file on a computer
somewhere else, and when you requested that URL that file was sent to
your computer.
</p>

<p>
So imagine it's 1995 and you're working at CERN and you want to write a
page. But you've forgotten what all the HTML tags are because there are
so many of them.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> So you'd open your web browser, which you wrote
yourself because, hey, you're Tim Berners-Lee now (it's your imagination
so why not?), and you type in a URL:
</p>

<pre class="example">
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html
</pre>

<p>
And you get a page of HTML, that you probably wrote, that tells you
about HTML tags that you probably came up with, served up by the web
server that you also wrote because, yes, you're Tim Berners-Lee.
</p>

<p>
This is the simplest way to think about the Web: you request an HTML
document from a server and it finds that document. The path to the file
on the server is <code>/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html</code> - it's just like a
directory structure on a computer.
</p>

<p>
If you've ever [built a static site][staticSite] this is exactly the
type of behaviour you're used to.
</p>

<p>
But there's another feature to your web server - the ability to
dynamically create the response that gets sent back. All of a sudden you
don't have to have a file in a directory to send back. It could be
anything.
</p>

<p>
For instance, it could be
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/coffee.html">a picture of the office
coffee machine this second</a>, so you know whether there's any coffee in
it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/xvcoffee.html
</pre>

<p>
or a way to search for pages with a certain word in:
</p>

<pre class="example">
http://info.cern.ch/search?term=h3
</pre>

<p>
or even just the current time:
</p>

<pre class="example">
http://time.gypsydave5.com/now
</pre>

<p>
Each of these URLs' responses should be generated on the server. So the
URLs are no longer the paths to a file which is returned when it is
requested, they're &#x2026; what? What does the URL mean if it is no longer a
way of getting a document from a filesystem? And what do you get if not
a document?

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-representations-and-resources">
<p>
What is the current time? Try and pick the right one:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
About half past one
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Thirty-seven minutes past one in the afternoon
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Halb eins uhr
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
13:37
</p>
</blockquote>

<pre class="example">
{
    "hour": "13",
    "minute": "37",
    "second": "35",
}
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>
2019-01-01 13:37:35
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
1546349825
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
or even
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://todo.com">http://todo.com</a>
</p>

<p>
Did you pick the right one? Is there a right one? What is 'now'? Can you
touch it? Can you taste it? Can point to it for me?
</p>

<p>
Sorry to get all philosophical, but 'now' is definitely <i>abstract</i> -
it's not a thing that you can see (like a document), but more of a
concept. But it's a concept that we can see represented in all of the
examples above - none of them 'is' 'now', but all of them are
representations of 'now'.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the key mental leaps that REST asks you to make - that
URLs are abstract things called <i>resources</i>. You will never have direct
access to a resource through HTTP; what you will get are
<i>representations</i> of that resource.
</p>

<p>
So which of the above representations is correct? All of them, of
course! So which one should we send back when someone requests
<code>http://time.gypsydave5.com/now</code>? Whichever one seems right to you.

You will also see the terms <i>URI</i> (Universal Resource Indicator),
<i>URN</i> (Universal Resource Name) and <i>IRI</i> (International Resource
Indicator). These all have specific meanings and were introduced
to try to clean up the specification. Some people will now claim
to be clever by saying that we <i>should</i> say URI rather than URL.
But the w3c are nothing if not pragmatic about these things; the
<a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#goals">living spec</a> for URLs now
says that we should "Standardize on the term URL. URI and IRI are
just confusing". Confusing and only ever used to make some people
feel smug and other people feel like outsiders so let's just
stick with URL.
