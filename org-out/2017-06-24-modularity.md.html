<p>
A while back an friend and I were talking about programming. They'd
recently taken it up in the job he was doing and were relatively fresh
to the discipline. Asking for a code review from a collegue, they'd been
told that their Python was pretty good but that it could do with
breaking out into smaller functions.
</p>

<p>
My friend couldn't see the point of this - the code worked, it did the
job, what's the problem? I had a crack at explaining why. Didn't do very
well.
</p>

<p>
More recently I was getting some feedback for something small I'd
written. It was, of course, awesome - like all the code I write.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
They said they liked it, but the modularity wasn't entirely necessary
because the individual modular parts wouldn't be reused.
</p>

<p>
So this is just a scratch piece to try to explain why I think modularity
is the most imortant thing
</p>

<p>
Oh and the title is an homage to my favourite xkcd comic:

<h2 id="wait-modularity">Wait, modularity?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-wait-modularity">
<p>
When I say 'modular', I mean small and isolated and independent. A class
that's a few lines long, the one line method in Ruby, the short
function. At a larger level I mean, well, larger small things. A file
with one class in it, or one function in it. Maybe I mean microservices.
Maybe not.
</p>

<p>
Look, I mean small things. That's all. But why do I think that they're
their own reward? Well, I don't<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> - but I think that, most of the
time, more good things come out of keeping the code smaller than larger.
Such as&#x2026;

<h2 id="easier-to-test">Easier to Test</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-easier-to-test">
<p>
What sort of tests do you love? When there are hundreds of them - which
ones make you happy inside? In my (admittedly limited) experience, it
tends to be the ones that run really quickly and don't randomly fail.
Sure, the ones that exercise the whole system are nice and necessary,
but the ones that make me smirk a little are the unit tests that whizz
by in the blink of an eye.
</p>

<p>
And in order to have those fast little tests, you need small little bits
of code to test.
</p>

<p>
TDD makes us write the tests first - and the easiest tests to write are
the ones that cover single, simple ideas that you want to implement. TDD
wants us to write small tests that consequently should lead us to write
small pieces of code.
</p>

<p>
Performing TDD produces code with tests - this is a given. But I find
that people celebrate this more that what I think the bigger prize is:
you have been forced into writing your code modularly, bringing with it
other and possibly greater advantages.
</p>

<h2 id="easier-to-comprehend">Easier to Comprehend</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-easier-to-comprehend">
<p>
This is probably the most important one. If your code is small and
independent, then there is a much higher chance of you and everyone else
understanding what it does. If a single function / class / method is
longer than a screen, I would go so far as to say that it's near
impossible to understand what it does.
</p>

<p>
If you're programming in small, easy to comprehend<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> parts, then
there is more chance that you'll be understood - if only because you'll
have had to give them names. Possibly bad names, but names all the same.
Names you'll be able to read and know what they mean and so what the
parts do. Or at the worst, names that you read, don't understand, and
then read the code, understand that because it's short, and then rename
it with something (hopefully) better.

<h2 id="easier-to-reuse">Easier to Reuse</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-easier-to-reuse">
<p>
Yes, reuse is good - it's a good benefit of small pieces of code. You
write that Fibonacci function, you can use it everywhere that you need a
Fibonacci number. It is part of the wonderful magic of small,
independent things.
</p>

<p>
Whether you do reuse a part of code is often by the by - it can often
come later on when you have a better idea about the thing that you're
trying to build.

<h2 id="this-all-sounds-familiar">This all sounds familiar&#x2026;</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-this-all-sounds-familiar">
<p>
Look, if you've heard this before then you probably have - hell, I just
worked out what I was talking about when I got to the end of writing it.
It's basically the first two bulletpoints of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a> - do
one thing well, and integrate with other programs.
</p>

<p>
But as we're not writing programs - we're just writing parts of
programs - we don't have to worry about the requirement for
generalization (that can come later if at all). That integration is
eased internally if we make the modules truely independent of each
other.
</p>

<p>
Like Lego blocks - some are small and general (think a 3x4 flat piece),
or small and specific (think a laser gun), but they're all small and
easy to integrate with each other.
