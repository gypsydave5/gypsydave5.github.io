<p>
The goal of this article is to examine and explain the HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) message types for a request and a response. Why
learn about HTTP? Because it's <i>fundamental</i> to a lot of the software we
build today - if it wasn't for HTTP
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>your JavaScript application in the browser wouldn't work</li>
<li>your API wouldn't be able to be used, let alone be RESTful</li>
<li>none of the 100s of microservice you've created could talk to each
other</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-who-is-this-for">
<p>
This is for every software developer, but especially for <i>web</i>
developers; people who build software either in the browser, or as
backend web servers. Especially for them as their programs are almost
entirely dependent upon HTTP to work.
</p>

<p>
This first part will cover the basics of HTTP, and an overview of the
HTTP message structure, both request and response. I've tried to make it
practical so there's some examples you can run on the command line in a
Unix like system (Linux, BSD, OSX), but which should work given some
tweaking for a Windows system.
</p>

<p>
By then end we should have covered
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the difference between the Internet and the (World Wide) Web</li>
<li>How HTTP is built on top of Internet protocols</li>
<li>how to use netcat to send TCP messages</li>
<li>using netcat to send and receive HTTP messages, and their anatomy</li>
<li>understood the benefits of plain text in communication</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2a02ba1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="what-is-the-internet-what-is-the-web">What is the Internet? What is the web?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-is-the-internet-what-is-the-web">
<p>
First up, the Internet is <i>not</i> the same as the web.
</p>

<p>
<i>An</i> internet is a collection of computer networks that are connected
together.
</p>

<p>
<i>The</i> Internet is <i>all</i> the computer networks in the world that are
connected to each other. Every. Damn. One.
</p>

<p>
And the web is&#x2026; well, we'll get to that.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning&#x2026; there weren't many computers at all. Maybe five? And
they were used for exciting things like calculating the yield of nuclear
bombs. But people realised they could do more with them if they could
communicate with each other. My computer could ask your computer to do
some of the work, and we'd get done in half the time.
</p>

<p>
But to communicate you need to share something - a language, a set of
signs. When someone says 'Hello' and they hold out their hand, what you
do next communicates a meaning - you can shake hands, or you can refuse.
You understand what the outheld hand means, you know what the
conventional responses are, and the other party knows what you mean when
you shake (or don't).
</p>

<p>
This is <i>protocol</i> - a series of conventions that govern communication.
The only other place that we talk about protocols tend to be when
interacting with royalty - we call the Queen "your Majesty" the first
time we address her, "ma'am" to rhyme with "ham" afterwards, and <i>we
never touch her</i>. This is how we behave to get along with the Queen.
</p>

<p>
Another protocol: you walk into a cafe, you sit down. And &#x2026; then what
happens? You expect the waiter to come over and take your order. They
will say something like 'Hi, what would you like to drink?', and you'll
say 'a coffee, please', and maybe there'll be a quick chat about milk,
sugar, or which one of the hundreds of different coffees you'd like.
What you don't do is walk into the cafe, walk up to the register and say
'skinny mocha to go please'&#x2026; or do you? It depends - you can tell what
you're meant to do when you walk in to most cafes and coffeeshops. We
learn the correct protocol very quickly (we often copy others) and then
we know what we're meant to do.
</p>

<p>
The early Internet was built on a series of protocols - the Internet
Protocol suite. For instance, one of these is the Internet Protocol
(IP) - a set of rules that the computers could conform to, to allow them
to communicate with each other no matter what operating system they were
using.
</p>

<p>
Protocols can stack up on top of each other. Say we walk into the cafe,,
sit down, the waiter comes over and says "Bonjour, qu'est-ce que vous
voulez boire"&#x2026; we know we're using the "ordering coffee in a cafe"
protocol, but instead of using the English 'protocol' to communicate it
the waiter is doing it in French. Why? Well, maybe you're in France.
What's interesting is that, even if you don't speak French, you kinda
know what they're saying because, well, it's a cafe - you know the
protocol. Instead of using the 'English' protocol, the waiter is using
'French' to communicate the 'Cafe' protocol - they hope you understand
French, and that you know what to do in a cafe.
</p>

<p>
The Transmission Communication Protocol (TCP) is another protocol that's
usually implemented on top of the Internet Protocol - and written as
"TCP/IP" ("TCP over IP"). TCP is a protocol that we should care about,
as it's the protocol that is used to implement the HyperText
Transmission Protocol - HTTP.
</p>

<p>
And that's the Web - things built on HTTP. Things like websites, and
webservices and your browser and all of this wonderful world we get to
live in 'online'.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1431970" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="worlds-simplest-chat-netcat-nc">World's Simplest Chat: netcat (<code>nc</code>)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-worlds-simplest-chat-netcat-nc">
<p>
Communication is often a two way thing - in TCP it definitely is.
</p>

<p>
To communicate we need two more pieces of information: who is going to
start the conversation, and where they are going to talk to. You may
have experienced the awkwardness when both people are waiting for the
other one to say something - luckily humans have quick ways to escape
this impasse, but computers need to be explicit.
</p>

<p>
In networking we call the computer waiting for messages a <i>server</i> (like
the waiter, giving you things), and the computer sending the messages a
<i>client</i> (like a &#x2026; client).
</p>

<p>
The 'where' is the IP address of a computer, and a <i>port</i> on that
computer. The IP address is a big number uniquely identifies a computer
on a network, and a port is like a port for a country - a place where
things go in and out. This is also a number. Computers have more than
one port because it's nice for a computer to talk to more than one
computer at once.
</p>

<p>
netcat "is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP" -
we can use it to see what sending and receiving messages over TCP
actually looks like by starting a server and a client on our computer.
</p>

<p>
But <i>we</i> are going to be the client and the server!
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Demo netcat and play along!
</p>

<p>
server: <code>nc -l 8000</code> client: <code>nc localhost 8000</code>

<p>
Send some messages See them pop up in the other session

<h2 id="the-http-request-message">The HTTP Request Message</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the-http-request-message">
<p>
We should see something like&#x2026;
</p>

<pre class="example">
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

</pre>

<p>
Every time you request a page with your browser, this is what it sends
to a server.
</p>

<p>
Which, although it's pretty gnarly, you can read pretty easily if you
know how.
</p>

<p>
There are <i>three</i> parts to the request message:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the <i>request line</i>, which is the first line of the message</li>
<li>the <i>headers</i>, which are every line after the request line. These are
optional</li>
<li>and, after a blank line, an optional <i>body</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="request-line">Request line</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-request-line">
<p>
Has three parts, each separated by a space.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <i>request method</i> (<code>GET</code>)</li>
<li>The <i>request target</i> or path (<code>/</code>)</li>
<li>The <i>HTTP version</i> (<code>HTTP/1.1</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cool. But what should we send back to the browser?

like?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A server on the web is a domain name (like <code>example.com</code>)</li>
<li>The web works over TCP - just like what we saw with netcat</li>
<li>What if we changed the server to a webserver on the internet?</li>
<li>We just need to point our netcat client at something other than
localhost</li>
</ol>

<p>
client: <code>nc -c -v example.com 80</code>
</p>

<p>
Why port 80? Because this is the conventional port for servers to be
listening on for HTTP requests. When you use a browser it always
<i>assumes</i> you want port 80 of the server you're communicating with. So
we're opening up a connection to the server at example.com.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the <code>-v</code> makes netcat <i>verbose</i> - so that we know it's working!</li>
<li>the <code>-c</code> fixes the line endings so that they conform with HTTP - don't
worry about it</li>
</ul>

<p>
We know what a valid HTTP request message looks like, but let's send an
invalid one for now
</p>

<pre class="example">
bum
</pre>

<p>
We get back the response:
</p>

<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;ERROR: The requested URL could not be retrieved&lt;/title&gt;

...
</pre>

<p>
Once again, this breaks down into three parts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the <i>status line</i></li>
<li>some (optional) headers</li>
<li>an optional body after an empty line</li>
</ul>

<p>
the body should be familiar - it's the HyperText Markup Language (HTML)!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org114fd3a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="status-line">Status line</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-status-line">
<p>
is once again very similar to the request line. It's made of
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <i>HTTP version</i> (<code>HTTP/1.1</code>)</li>
<li>The <i>status code</i> (<code>200</code>)</li>
<li>The a description of the status code or path (<code>/</code>)</li>
</ul>

<li>Send an HTTP GET request using the browser - notice you don't need the

<p>
Now lets send something back!
</p>

<pre class="example">

</pre>

<p>
One gotcha - the browser needs to know that your message has finished -
you could have more lines of body to add. To do this you need to send a
special signal called End of File (EOF), which we can type by pressing
Ctrl-D.
</p>

<p>
Now look at your browser.

<p>
We make HTTP requests every day, most obviously when browsing the Web.
The content of these requests is usually well hidden by the browser as
they're irrelevant to the everyday use, but it's easy to see what's
going on.
</p>

<p>
Browsers usually have a set of 'developer tools'
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>open up a browser</li>
<li>open up the 'developer tools'</li>
<li>find the network tab</li>
<li>make a request for the URL <code>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/</code></li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-q-why--c-for-the-netcat-client">
<p>
Because the HTTP protocol requires that each line be terminated by two
invisible characters - carriage-return and line-finish (LF CR). On most
computers, hitting return will only emit one character (LF), so <code>-c</code>
tells netcat to add in the extra CR. You will hit this problem
repeatedly in your careers, mostly around files saved on Windows
machines (which use CRLF by convention).
