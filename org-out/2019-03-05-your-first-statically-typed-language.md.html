<p>
Most people's first programming language is a dynamically typed,
interpreted language - JavaScript, Python or Ruby. These are good
languages to learn programming with, and you can be productive with all
three of them. But there's a separate category of languages in
widespread use: statically typed, compiled languages - C, Go, Java, C#
and others. This article will try to explain the difference between the
two language categories, look at their advantages and disadvantages, and
then consider what would be a good choice of statically typed language
for a programmer who is only familiar with dynamically typed languages
to learn.

The target audience of this article is someone who is comfortable with
programming in a dynamically typed language and who is interested in
learning a statically typed language, and wants to know why it is worth
while. The examples are in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and Go, but no
knowledge of these languages is required. This is based on my own
experience of being a self-taught developer who started working in Ruby
and JavaScript and has extended to languages like Go, TypeScript, Kotlin
and Rust.

<p>
There are two pairs of opposites to look at here: <i>dynamically typed</i>
vs. /statically typed/, and <i>compiled</i> vs. /interpreted/. Let's go
through them in that order.

<h3 id="dynamic-vs-static-typing">Dynamic vs Static typing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-dynamic-vs-static-typing">
<p>
If someone asked you:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What's five added to a banana?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You would be confused - what do they mean? It looks like they've made a
mistake. Maybe they don't know what the meaning of 'add' is, or what a
'banana' is. Maybe they have a different meaning of 'add' to us.
Something has gone wrong somewhere though, as their question doesn't
make sense to us.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Programming languages have a way of telling us that an expression
written in the language do or do not make sense. They do this by using
the <i>type</i> that every value in a programming language has. In
dynamically typed languages we only really become aware of types when we
use a value of one type in the wrong way - when we say something that
doesn't 'make sense'.
</p>

<p>
For instance, in Python we can write this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">5 + <span style="color: #666666;">"banana"</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Try saving that in a file called <code>typecheck.py</code> and executing it with
<code>python typecheck.py</code>. You should get the following error in your
terminal:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "typecheck.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    5 + "banana"
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
</pre>

<p>
This is a type error - you can tell that from the way it says
<code>TypeError</code> in the error message. The error is telling you that you
can't <code>+</code> the types <code>int</code> and <code>str</code> together. Which is fair enough; just
like you don't know how to add together 5 and a banana, neither does
Python.
</p>

<p>
The type error is thrown by a <i>type checker</i>, which checks that all the
types in an expression are being used in the right way. The type checker
kicks in when the Python program runs and checks that the two things
that are being =+=ed together are of the right type.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Type checking can happen at one of two times: when the program is
running (commonly called 'run time') or sometime before then.
Dynamically typed languages have their types checked at run time - this
is what happened with the Python program we ran above; the type error
become apparent when the program was run. Statically typed languages
have their types checked before they are run.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org86a648f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="type-annotations">Type annotations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-type-annotations">
<p>
In order for the type checker to accurately check the types in a
statically typed language, you will often have to explicitly declare the
type of a variable through a <i>type annotation</i>. A type annotation is a
little extra information you add to a variable to say what type it is.
In English we can imagine adding type annotations to our nouns and verbs
as extra information in parentheses. So our simple sentence:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What's five added to a banana?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Becomes
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What's five (which is a number) added (adding is something you do to
numbers) to a banana (which is a fruit)?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Which might be good evidence that natural language is not a place for
type annotations.
</p>

<p>
With these English type annotations we don't need to know what 'five'
is, what a 'banana' is, and what 'addition' is, to know that this
sentence doesn't make sense. We don't even need to know what a 'number'
is. We just know that the verb in the middle needs two nouns to be of
the type 'number' for this sentence to be valid. We could perform this
kind of check automatically just by looking at the words without having
to know anything about their meaning - we can't do 'adding' to a
'fruit'. The type checker in a statically typed language works in the
same way.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Let's see a type annotation in TypeScript, a statically typed variation
of JavaScript:
</p>

<pre class="example">
var theNumberFive: number = 5
</pre>

<p>
This declares that the variable <code>theNumberFive</code> has the type <code>number</code>,
and assigns the value <code>5</code> to it.
</p>

<p>
The equivalent in JavaScript would be:
</p>

<pre class="example">
var theNumberFive = 5
</pre>

<p>
Exactly the same, only without the type annotation.
</p>

<p>
We can also add type declarations to function signatures. The function
<code>add</code> in JavaScript:
</p>

<pre class="example">
function add(n1, n2) {
    return n1 + n2
}
</pre>

<p>
looks like this in TypeScript:
</p>

<pre class="example">
function add(n1: number, n2: number): number {
    return n1 + n2
}
</pre>

<p>
We're saying that the function <code>add</code> takes two arguments, <code>n1</code> which is
a <code>number</code> and <code>n2</code> which is a <code>number</code>, and returns a value which is
also a <code>number</code>.
</p>

<p>
These annotations will be used by the TypeScript type checker, which
runs when the TypeScript is <i>compiled</i>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org6253b1e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="compiled-interpreted">Compiled / Interpreted</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-compiled-interpreted">
<p>
In an interpreted language such as JavaScript each line of the program
is read and executed in sequence, one after the other,<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> by an
interpreter, which builds up the running process from the program you
wrote, line by line.
</p>

<p>
Compilation is the act of turning the program you've written in one
language into another language. For TypeScript, the target language is
JavaScript. And during the compilation - at 'compile time' - the type
checker will analyze the TypeScript program for any errors.
</p>

<p>
Compilers are usually used to translate a high level programming
language (like JavaScript) into a lower level language like an assembly
language or machine code. In the case of TypeScript, the compiler
outputs another high level language - JavaScript.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Compiled vs. interpreted is barely ever a cut and dried distinction when
with a particular programming language - an interpreter will sometimes
have a compilation step which runs just before the code executes,<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>
and the output of a compiler will have to be run by an interpreter. In
addition, being compiled or interpreted is not a property of the
language itself. There are compilers for languages that are normally
interpreted, and interpreters for languages that are normally compiled.
</p>

<p>
For a statically typed, compiled language, the compilation step is where
the type checker runs. Type checking is useful for the compiler as it
allows it to make optimizations in the performance of the software - if
a variable is always going to be a <code>number</code> it can optimize the memory
locations used.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-type-checking-catches-mistakes">
<p>
Let's put this all together and write our example natural language
'expression' in both JavaScript and TypeScript we will soon see one of
the advantages of a statically typed language
</p>

<pre class="example">
var five = 5
var banana = "banana"

function add(n1, n2) {
    return n1 + n2
}

add(five, banana)
</pre>

<p>
which will give us the result
</p>

<pre class="example">
'5banana'
</pre>

<p>
Oh JavaScript&#x2026; more than happy to <code>+</code> <i>anything</i> together.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> It's
easy to laugh at this sort of error, but I've seen teams working on
JavaScript bugs for days based on a number being stored as a string.
It's an easy mistake to make. It's also the sort of bug that will
<i>never, ever</i> happen to you - until it happens to you.
</p>

<p>
But if we try to replicate the same bug in TypeScript
</p>

<pre class="example">
var five: number = 5
var banana: string = "banana"

function add(n1: number, n2: number): number {
    return n1 + n2
}

add(five, banana)
</pre>

<p>
When we compile this with the TypeScript compiler<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>
</p>

<pre class="example">
add.ts:8:11 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

8 add(five, banana)
            ~~~~~~


Found 1 error.
</pre>

<p>
The TypeScript compiler has caught our mistake and has even underlined
where we went wrong - we can't put a <code>string</code> where a <code>number</code> is meant
to go.
</p>

<p>
This is the biggest advantage of static typing from the programmer's
perspective; the type checker makes sure that we're not doing anything
<i>stupid</i> like using a <code>string</code> like it's a <code>number</code>. All of a sudden
we've got a new level of certainty about how the program we've written
will work - without even running it.

<div id="outline-container-orga182ed0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="editor-integration">Editor integration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-editor-integration">
<p>
But the fun of type checking doesn't end with compilation - far from it.
Because a type checker can run even before you compile your program it
can integrate with your text editor, to giving you information about
your program as you're writing it. Because the type annotations declare
what the type of a variable is, the editor can now tell you useful
things like which methods are available to use on it.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>

<h3 id="compiled-code-runs-faster">Compiled code runs faster</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-compiled-code-runs-faster">
<p>
Compilation doesn't just translate one language into another; the
compiler also looks at your program and tries to work out ways to make
it run faster or more efficiently. Recursive function calls get turned
into simple loops, for instance.

<h3 id="compilation-takes-time">Compilation takes time</h3>

<p>
Compilation of a program can take a long time. Less time these days with
fast computers and good compilers, but still something like two or three
minutes in the worst cases I've experienced. If your workflow is reliant
on fast, tight feedback loops then you might start to find a compiler
annoying you as your program increases in size.

<p>
If you're used to a dynamically typed language, the verbosity of a
statically typed language can be off-putting. Having to declare the
types of every variable and function parameter can become wearing on the
eyes. A modern language will try to take away the strain of this by
inferring the type of variables where it can, but older statically typed
languages like Java, C#, C++ and C can look verbose.

<p>
The verbosity of a statically typed language is made clear at the
boundaries of a program - where it interacts with 'the world'. A number
of extra steps are required to wrangle the data coming into your system.
This becomes apparent when parsing JSON - to get the full benefit of
types in your system you'll have to take the general <code>JSON</code> type and
turn it into one of your types, which can be pretty arduous. A dynamic
language makes this a lot easier (although more open to type errors as
seen above).

<p>
So what's a good statically typed, compiled language to start with?
</p>

<p>
If I had a lot of experience with JavaScript then there might be a good
argument to try TypeScript, but I find that languages that compile to
JavaScript introduce a layer of overhead and tooling that can stop you
focusing on the language.
</p>

<p>
I would advise steering away from Java as there's a lot of unnecessary
cruft and complication in the language, some of which is a hangover from
C. For instance, compare
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">User</span> <span style="color: #333333;">user</span> = <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">User</span>()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
in Java, which always makes me feel like I've written the word <code>user</code> at
least two too many times, to this in Go
</p>

<pre class="example">
user := NewUser()
</pre>

<p>
If you <i>did</i> want to look at a statically typed language built on the
JVM, Kotlin is a good choice.
</p>

<p>
The best choice in my opinion is the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go
programming language</a>. It has a simple type system (there are no
generic types to worry about), the language's syntax is small and easy
to learn, the tooling and documentation are best in class, and it's
increasingly popular. Take a look at the <a href="https://gobyexample.com/">Go
By Example</a> or <a href="https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests">Learn Go
