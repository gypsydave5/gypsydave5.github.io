<p>
Ever run a marthon? No, me neither. I've run a few halfs, so let's
pretend that's adequate experience to talk about marathon running.
</p>

<p>
Long distance runners talk about this moment when the glycogen in your
body runs out entirely. You'll get about two hours, maybe more if you
train. But it'll happen, and all your energy just - goes. Seratonin
levels go up, which might sound fun until I tell you that your dopamine
goes down as well. This might be causing some of the little voices in
your head to tell you that you can't do it. You may hallucinate. You may
not be able to stand.
</p>

<p>
I hit the mental equivalent of the wall sometime over the week we
started learning <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> at Makers. I'd
done my preparation, I'd learned and digested solidly. I'd say I was one
of the better prepared for the next twelve weeks.
</p>

<p>
But you can only delay the wall - you can't put it off entirely. I ran
out of whatever mental stamina I had. And it hurt. A lot.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Depressesed? Disheartened? Hate coding? Hate what you're doing to yourself? Hate
Sinatra (the framework)? Hate Sinatra (the singer)? Wonder what you're still
doing here? How *can* anyone learn to code in twelve weeks? Stupid. Impossible.
You'd be better back at the library. Hell, you'd be better back at the cannary.
Stupid brain that won't work. Stupid.
</pre>

<p>
We can reach for another running metaphor: second wind. Even at the
point of greatest exertion, you can find a way to carry on. Going even
faster sometimes. Like you can push through the wall and find yourself
suddenly back to normal again.
</p>

<p>
This happened too - and kept happening. Because I didn't just hit one
wall. I've hit at least three since the first one. You get <i>used</i> to it.
Flailing ignorance and mental exhaustion is aleviated by the next piece
of hard-won knowldege and skill.
</p>

<p>
I've found relaxation to be as important as work. I'm reading fiction
again, getting to bed in good time, appreciating a quiet beer. Taking
your mind off the problem until it's ready to be solved.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about philosophy, and Deleuze &amp; Guattari's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus">A Thousand
Plateaus</a>, I think of the organism that can only grow by dying a little
every day. Growth is painful. Growth is hard. But nothing worthwhile was
ever easy.
</p>

<p>
You beat it. I couldn't do Sinatra, I couldn't make it do what I wanted
it to do. But I made it do something, learned my limitations. And I
enjoyed myself. And now <a href="http://rpssd.gypsydave5.com/">you can play
with it</a>.
</p>

<p>
The pace is picking up this week. Last week threw Sinatra in our faces.
This week is databases. Learning to program is one thing - keeping all
these spinning plates up in the air at the same time is another.
</p>

<p>
And only half the race run.
