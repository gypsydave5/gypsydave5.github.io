<blockquote>
<p>
Hey folks!
</p>

<p>
The Node and JavaScript dragons have been hard to fight&#x2026; Do you
remember you used to look at precious stones?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's how Enrique's email introduced the Friday challenge at the end of
week 8 at Makers. Week 8 has been Hell Week. It was a beasting. It was
hard. It was NodeJS.
</p>

<p>
I was looking forward to this week more than any other - it's a great
idea. More and more devs and companies are using Node, Rails is so
opinionated as to be stifiling - so why not do another week of
JavaScript dedicated to Node? Throw some CoffeeScript in there for good
measure along with a seasoning of WebSockets and you've got a recipe for
succeess.
</p>

<p>
Nope. See above. You've got a recipe for Hell Week.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript was a severe shock to the system for everyone. I was already
relatively comfortable with the language - it wasn't entirely new to me.
But I still struggled with getting Express and Node.
</p>

<p>
I knew that JS was asynchronous - but I didn't really <i>know</i> it, if you
take my meaning. The difference between Sinatra and Express became
apparent from the beginning. Where on Sinatra it was fairly easy to get
RSpec and Capybara performing tests out of the box, with Mocha it felt
like I was contantly and actively fighting against the framework.
Callbacks came back unexpectedly or not at all. Tests passed - twice -
when they should've failed.
</p>

<p>
The final straw came when we collectively couldn't get read/write
operations working consistently. I suddenly realised how spoiled I've
been by using Ruby, RSpec et al &#x2013; these are really mature pieces of
software that act as you expect. I feel that Node and Express are
amazing - don't get me wrong. But I've found it nigh-on impossible to
test them.
</p>

<p>
And if you can't test it, then it doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
I'm still pressing on with Node/Express on the side, because I do really
enjoy the environment to work in. I just need to slay the Mocha dragon
and everything will be fine.
</p>

<p>
The Ruby refresher that was presented as the weekend work was like a
beautiful sorbet - so refreshing after the hard week. As I answered the
questions with simple one-liner methods I realised exactly how much I'd
learned in the last eight weeks. I feel like I've got a firm foothold in
the Ruby world.
</p>

<p>
Now on to the Mocha.
