When I was thinking about writing tests in C, it led me to almost
entirely reevaluate the way I think about tests. If you just want to see
how to test in C (or how I do it anyway), skip to the end. Otherwise&#x2026;

<p>
When I learned to practice test-driven development (TDD), I learned in
Ruby using RSpec. It was wonderful! RSpec has a delightful syntax,
reading like English. Like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">describe <span style="color: #666666;">"add"</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">do</span>
    it <span style="color: #666666;">"knows that five plus two makes seven"</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">do</span>
        expect(add 2, 5).to equal 7
    <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">end</span>
<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's worth bearing in mind that it took a long time to recognize that
this was a series of nested function calls, each with its own code
block. Definitely the start of this was when I started writing tests in
JavaScript using the Mocha framework:
</p>

<pre class="example">
describe('add', function () {
    it('knows that five plus two makes seven', function() {
        expect(add(2, 5)).to.equal(7);
    });
});
</pre>

<p>
The anonymous =function=s made it much more obvious to me: this is just
JavaScript; there is no magic.
</p>

<h2 id="back-to-basics">Back to basics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-back-to-basics">
<p>
When I saw a pair of experienced developers hacking on Python for the
first time, I asked them what sort of testing framework they were
using - I was curious! "We're not using a framework," they said, "we're
just using <code>assert</code>."
</p>

<p>
This reminded me of my nightmare first experience with Java, where I
abused the JUnit version of <code>assert</code> all over the place. But I hadn't
realized that it came 'for free' in some languages. In fact, in most
languages.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6c36d13" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="what-is-a-test">What is a test?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-is-a-test">
<p>
A test is a way of saying whether something works or not. We could do
this in a repl, we could do it by running a program and using it -
manual testing. But more commonly we write another program to use the
first program. This is what a test framework is - a program that tests
your program.
</p>

<p>
Given this, we need a way to communicate a description of our program to
the test program - this is what we can see in the Ruby and JavaScript
examples above. We're making a statement about our program ('two plus
five equals seven') in the test framework's domain language, and saying
that this should be true. At root, all tests come down to this: is
something true or not?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgecf23b0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="enter-assert">Enter <code>assert</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-enter-assert">
<p>
The original intention of <code>assert</code> in C was as an assertion that could
be included inside the program itself. You would be able to compile your
program either with the assertions turned on, or turned off by disabling
debugging.
</p>

<p>
This way of using <code>assert</code> doesn't really work for TDD - you can't run
the assertion without having the code in the first place. In addition,
you don't get what for me is one of the chief advantages of TDD, namely
enforced separation of concerns.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5cc0158" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="wait-separation-of-concerns">Wait, separation of concerns?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-wait-separation-of-concerns">
<p>
In order to test some aspect of your software on its own, it needs to be
separable from the rest of the code; the testing will drive this. As you
build each new part, you test it separately from the rest.
</p>

<p>
So how to we break up a C program? The first step should be familiar to
most developers: wrap everything in a function.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga54f295" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="functions-in-c">Functions in C</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-functions-in-c">
<p>
We've already seen a function in C - the <code>main</code> function. Declaring our
own is a doddle; let's do some addition:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #cdad00; font-weight: bold;">#include</span> <span style="color: #666666;">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">add</span>(<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333;">a</span>, <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333;">b</span>) {
    <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">return</span> a + b;
}

<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">main</span>() {
    <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333;">answer</span> = add(1, 1);
    printf(<span style="color: #666666;">"one plus one is: %d"</span>, answer);
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This stuff shouldn't be too surprising. The only things worth mentioning
are that there is no magic function declaration keyword like <code>function</code>
or <code>def</code>. In C it's the presence of the parentheses after the name that
make it into a function. We do need to declare the return type - in both
instances it's an <code>int</code> like we saw in
<a href="file:///posts/2016/8/9/learning-the-c-programming-language-part-1:-hello,-world/">the
first post</a>. This is the first time we've seen arguments in a function
though - and it's probably not surprising that they've typed as well. In
C the type goes before the name.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> So <code>add</code> takes two =int=s and
returns an int. Hooray.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and like JavaScript we have to remember to <code>return</code> the result.
