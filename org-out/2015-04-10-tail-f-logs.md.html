<p>
Debugging a series of microservices locally can be a pain. You need to
see all of the logs for each service, live, and hopefully all in one
place to save you time trying to work out what's going on at the same
time.
</p>

<p>
You could run each service in a separate terminal, but that doesn't help
manage reading the logs at once and doesn't scale well. Alternatively
the services can be run in the background and we could send their output
to the same terminal. But that is going to look messy - how will we know
which service is logging?
</p>

<p>
So let's send STDERR and STDOUT to a couple of files - we can do this in
whatever we use to launch the services, but in bash it looks something
like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">run_service &gt; service_name.log 2&gt; service_name.err &amp;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we've got a lot of files, slowly filling with logs. But we're
definitely not reading them all at once. Enter the hero of the piece,
<code>tail -f</code>. <code>tail</code> is a nice little Unix command that has the standard
behaviour of reading the last 10 line of a file. Handy now and then, but
no big deal. <code>tail -f</code>, though, is a superhero. It "causes tail to not
stop when end of file is reached, but rather to wait for additional data
to be appended to the input" (I'm quoting straight from the <code>man</code> page).
</p>

<p>
What that means is that <code>tail</code> waits for more lines to be added to the
file, and prints them when they are. Live logs are back - but only for
one file. But <code>tail</code> has another neat feature: reading from multiple
files. Just put them all in as arguments or splat them with a <code>*</code> like
<code>tail -f *.log *.err</code>.
</p>

<p>
Which has this lovely looking output:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">==&gt; service_one.err &lt;==
Here are some errors from service_one

==&gt; service_one.log &lt;==
And here are some logs from service_one

==&gt; service_two.err &lt;==
With the same deal...

==&gt; service_two.log &lt;==
... for service_two
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And just carries on outputting as your services run, letting you keep an
eye on all of them at once while you get back to work.
