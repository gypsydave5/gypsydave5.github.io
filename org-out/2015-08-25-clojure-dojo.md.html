<div class="post-date">16 Sep 2020</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2015-08-25-clojure-dojo.md.html">Clojure Dojo</a></h1>
<p>
I've just got back from
<a href="http://www.londonclojurians.org/dojos.html">Clojure Dojo</a> over at the
<a href="www.thoughtworks.com">Thoughtworks</a> offices in Soho. The Clojure
Dojos have been run by the <a href="www.londonclojurians.html">London
Clojurians</a> for about five years now and are still going strong. I've
been meaning to go to one for a while, and tonight the stars were right.
</p>

<p>
What's a Clojure Dojo? Developers gather in a room full of pizza<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
with computers and chat about which editors they use.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> Then someone
very sensibly says we should probably start.
</p>

<p>
First we introduce ourselves, tell everyone how much we know about
Clojure and what the first language we learned was.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> There were a
good mix of people in tonight, a few who had been doing Clojure for
years, many for months, and a few like me who have been dabbling their
toes in the water for a while. I was heartened to see a Maker there who
had graduated on Friday - that takes some guts and enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Then we pitch ideas to hack on for the evening. They were all great
ideas, from Conway's Game of Life to Google Maps plugins that show
extinct species. The winner was a Twitter Markov Generator - an awesome
idea that generates new tweets based upon a history of tweets, picking
the next word based upon the likely hood that it follows from the
previous word in the history.
</p>

<p>
We were split into random groups of 3-4 and - just got on with it. After
about two hours the teams gathered together once more to show off their
(completely unfinished) products. Then we all went home.
</p>

<p>
The subject sounded fairly dry to me, but it turned out to be plenty to
get my teeth stuck in to - I'd almost recommend it as a kata. I was
working with three other devs - Fabio, who'd been working on Clojure for
about a year and had the most wicked Emacs/Cider<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> set up that was a
joy to watch him code with. There was also Francis who had been looking
at Clojure 'for about two weeks', but had a Lisp background that just
shone through. And happily we also had
<a href="https://twitter.com/ctford">Chris</a>, the convener of the Dojo who had
been working in Clojure for four years or so. He helped a lot, and was
great to chat with about practices, concepts and the style of Clojure.
</p>

<p>
I learned a lot in a short space of time, refreshing my brief exposure
to the language quite quickly.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> But the best bit was when we
planned the data structure. Initially we were looking at nested hash-map
arrangement, with the inner map indicating the percentage chance of each
next word - something like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">{ <span style="color: #666666;">"Word"</span> { <span style="color: #666666;">"nextWord1"</span> 1, <span style="color: #666666;">"nextWord2"</span> 10, <span style="color: #666666;">"nextWord3"</span> 79} }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But then Francis suggested that we just hold a list of a hundred words
that represented the probability distribution:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">{ <span style="color: #666666;">"Word"</span> [<span style="color: #666666;">"nextWord1"</span>
          <span style="color: #666666;">"nextWord2"</span> <span style="color: #d9d9d9;">;; </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">ten times</span>
          <span style="color: #666666;">"nextWord3"</span>] <span style="color: #d9d9d9;">;; </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">eighty odd times</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To which I responded that we may as well just collect up all of the next
words and randomly sample from it. I thought this would make everyone go
'oh, but that'd be too long' but, no, everyone liked it. So massive,
massive vectors it was.
</p>

<p>
My next favourite moment was when I wondered whether we'd be slowly
feeding the tweets in one by one to a function to build the hash-map.
No, Fabio (I think) said - we'll just combine them into one giant string
and feed it in.
</p>

<p>
One. Giant string. Of all the tweets. Mind blown. Not quite big data,
but I loved the epic processing powers it felt like we were harnessing -
lightning of the gods and all that good stuff.
</p>

<p>
I discovered is all my practice in functional languages over the last
few months means that I can put together a recursive function pretty
quickly and accurately. Unfortunately I also discovered I can't come up
with a decent name when typing - and I also found out that there's
little appetite for a refactor in a Dojo. That function's name is my
eternal shame.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
We had something fairly decent by the end of the Dojo. More exiciting
was seeing what the other teams had produced. One team had made this
glorious and terse looking almost one liner (and it really could have
done with being put on a few more lines) that seemed to have more
functionality than I could believe. Another team practiced their
TDD<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> and also created and elegant 'word shifting' move that
provided the word-nextWord pairs without any recursion. And the final
team wrote no code per se, but spent a productive few hours setting up a
Clojure project and investigating the useful libraries that could help
in the project.
</p>

<p>
I feel that I could see more of what the fuss about Clojure was about.
Each team had thought about the nature of the data they were going to
create and work on, linking it to the functions they were using to
translate the input into the output. The beauty came in the diverse
implementations, both in data and functions, and just how terse yet
expressive both were. It's left me wanting more.
</p>

<p>
A friendly atmosphere, enthusiastic programmers, a great language and
problem to play with - and did I mention the pizza? I'm already looking
forward to the next one.
</p>

<p>
Many, many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ctford">Chris Ford</a> for
organising and Thoughtworks for hosting!

I'm not even going to get into whether we should have been TDDing
or whether the repl can cover some of those requirements. I'll
call it a massive spike for now and move on to TDDing it when I
do it again.
