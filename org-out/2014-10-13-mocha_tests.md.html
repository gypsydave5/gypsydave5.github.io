<p>
I've been continuing my assault on Node.js - I refuse to let it lie. I
decided two weeks ago to try and get a version of the Makers Academy
chitter project (a twitter clone) up and running using Node, Express
and - because you may as well go straight in at the deep end - MongoDB.
Let's call it 'Chitter.js'.
</p>

<p>
The biggest pain I've had is getting the tests to run. This may not
sound like a big deal to someone on the outside, but without tests I
feel a little lost &#x2013; I mean, how do you know if what you're doing is
working? Or your refactoring hasn't changed anything?
</p>

<p>
Anyway, enough of the TDD rant - and maybe let's just approach this as
an intellectual exercise. Mocha is the test framework we're using &#x2013;
along with the Chai library of assertion (so I can write <code>expect</code>) a
lot.
</p>

<p>
Now the first thing to bear in mind is just how asynchronous
<i>everything</i> is when working in JavaScript. You may <i>think</i> you
understand, but you proaably don't. My entire cohort at Makers is
replete with tales about testing in Mocha ("It passed one time &#x2013; but
then it didn't" &#x2026; "I ran it, it should've failed. But it passed.
Twice.").
</p>

<p>
Happily Mocha gives us <code>done</code>. You can pass any test block (OK, not
block, anonymous function. But I'm Ruby till I die) an argument of
<code>done</code>, which is a function you can call when the test is&#x2026; well, when
the test is done. It basically means that you can make thinga happen
when you want them to happen, and not in faster-than-a-speeding-bullet
JS timeframes.
</p>

<p>
So, here's a test straight out of my actual project. The key thing to
note is the fact that the expectations are sitting in the callback for
the <code>save</code> function - you'll only want to test the database once the
save has saved (i.e. once its calledback).
</p>

<p>
(The following is all in CoffeeScript - which I'm agnostic about. It
definitely has the advantage of brevity, which is a quality all of its
own.)
</p>

<pre class="example">
it 'saves users', (done) -&gt;
    bob = new user {username: "bob", password: "pisswird"}
    bob.save (error, saved_bob) -&gt;
        expect(saved_bob.username).to.equal "bob"
        expect(saved_bob.password).to.equal "pisswird"
        done()
</pre>

<p>
You would expect this to run, test the expectations, and then let you
know it's all finished with the <code>done()</code> call at the end of the
callback. And it does do exactly that &#x2013; but only so long as the
expectations pass. If they don't the whole thing just times out - which
is not what we're after.
</p>

<p>
I tried a number of solutions to this problem (in fact the above <i>is</i>
one of those solutions - the first attempts were even more worthless),
including a few experiments with the
<a href="http://chaijs.com/plugins/chai-as-promised">Chai as Promised</a> library
which includes such great statements as <code>to.eventually.deep.equal</code> But
the problem wasn't resolved until I hit upon the following pattern:
</p>

<pre class="example">
it 'saves users', (done) -&gt;
  user = new User {username: "bob", password: "pisswird"}
  user.save (error, saved_user) -&gt;
    try
      expect( saved_user.username ).to.eql "bob"
      done()
    catch error
      done(error)
</pre>

<p>
What wizardry is this? Let me try to explain&#x2026;
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The reason everything timed out on the expectation failing was that
the expectation statement is no longer in the scope of the <code>it()</code>.</li>
<li>Expectations pass when they pass &#x2013; but when they fail they raise an
exception which is caught by the <code>it()</code> function the whole lot is
wrapped in.</li>
<li>So when the statement goes out of scope, it means that the error
never 'bubbles up' to the <code>it</code>, the <code>done()</code> never gets called, and
the whole thing just times out.</li>
<li>So we need a way to send the error for the failed expectation up to
the <code>it()</code>.</li>
<li>This is where the <code>try/catch</code> comes in - if the expectation fails it
raises an error that then gets passed to the <code>done</code> function in the
catch - which the <code>done</code> then dutifully carries back up to the <code>it</code>
with the essential error information about what exactly went wrong.</li>
</ol>

<p>
And so now we can write tests. Hurrah! But, more importantly, we've
gained an insight into how testing frameworks work. When I first
encountered testing in RSpec I went through the various patterns of test
as ritual &#x2013; 'this is how you do it' &#x2013; but the more I work with tests
the more I'm respecting the hard work that's gone in to making them look
like magick.
</p>

<p>
So I'm really greateful for Mocha being a bit of a pain to test with
over the last few weeks, as it's made me have to think a bit harder
about testing in general and the dark arts of JS.
</p>

<p>
That said, it's not done much for the development of chitter.js&#x2026;
