<p>
One line review: <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/"><i>Clojure for the Brave
and True</i></a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/nonrecursive">Daniel Higginbotham</a>
is a pretty good intro to Clojure, if you can get past the undergraduate
humour.
</p>

<p>
<i>Clojure for the Brave and True</i> could be thought of as a part of a
loose trilogy of books, including <a href="http://landoflisp.com/"><i>Land of
Lisp</i></a> and <a href="http://realmofracket.com/"><i>Realm of Racket</i></a>,<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> that
explore modern Lisps in a light hearted way with cartoons.
</p>

<p>
The first problem with this comparison is that <i>Brave &amp; True</i> is nowhere
near as good as <i>Land of Lisp</i> - Barski's jokes are funnier, his
cartoons are better, the content is both deeper and broader. <i>Land of
Lisp</i> has a chapter called "Let's build a Web Server from Scratch" and
it's not lying. Whereas <i>Brave &amp; True</i> won't even show you the ropes on
something like <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a>.
</p>

<p>
The best chapters in <i>Brave and True</i>, which are also the most useful
ones, are the ones where you're being walked through a piece of code
line by line. The
'<a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/functional-programming/">Peg thing</a>'
game is a great example of a interactive command-line game written using
a series of pure functions. This chapter gives you a real idea of how to
get some Clojure code doing stuff in the world - a practical toolkit to
let you get writing something.
</p>

<p>
The other great thing about this book is its opinionated introduction to
editors. I struggled mightily setting up something to do my Lisps in,
having gone through a variety of Vim and Emacs setups with every damn
plugin you can imagine. <i>Brave and True</i> has
<a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/">an entire chapter dedicated
to getting a decent Emacs environment</a> (you can download the
configuration), complete with Cider and Paredit. It's not going to teach
you everything you want to know, but once you're done you will be
immediately productive and able to get along with the more serious task
of actually writing some Clojure.
</p>

<p>
But I often found the sense of humour in this book grating. It is as if
I was forced to hang around with my fourteen-year-old self.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> The
one who'd memorized a lot of <i>Monty Python</i> and <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy</i> and thought that quoting it back at my friends was the
height of sophisticated humour. The examples feel contrived to fit the
humour, often to the detriment of the point that is trying to be made.
</p>

<p>
The poorest chapters are the ones where an idea is introduced but not
fully explored. When introduced to protocols and records it would be
nice to understand how they are used to leverage polymorphism in
something more practical than the contrived Richard-Simmons-as-Werewolf
examples that felt even less useful than the usual Object Oriented Guide
to Animal Taxonomy we're forced to endure.
</p>

<p>
<i>Brave and True</i> is a good book, and is worth buying and reading (and if
you want to sample the content it's all available on
<a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">the book's excellent website</a>). It's
filled me with confidence to write Clojure (probably before other
languages) and to read more books on Clojure. I just wish that it had
spent less time crapping around with spurious examples and more time
showing me how and why Clojure is the best.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm going to read <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">my favourite
introduction to Lisp</a> again (keep scrolling) and maybe finish <i>Land of
Lisp</i>.
