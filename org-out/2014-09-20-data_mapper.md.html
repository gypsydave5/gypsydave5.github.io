<p>
I love <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a>, the lightweight Object
Relational Mapper for Ruby. We've been using it with Sinatra. It's
skinny, it's simple, it's clever, it makes the right tables happen in
Postgres and the syntax is surprisingly simple. For instance, the email
field for a user table:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">property <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">:email</span>, <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">unique:</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">true</span>, <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">required:</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">true</span>, <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">format</span>: email_address
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Look! It's amazing &#x2013; not only do we set the property, but we've made it
required and unique, and we've validated that it's an email address.
Amazing!
</p>

<p>
I love it, but like all wonderful DSLs when it's good it's very very
good, but when it's bad it's <i>horrid</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the example I was working on I was creating a user which could be
associated with many posts - it was a basic Twitter like app. The user
had some requirements as above - specifically those listed for the
email, but also that the user name was unique and that the password was
more than six characters long. So far so incredibly boring.
</p>

<p>
I set the wheels in motion, I write a feature test in Cucumber to see if
as a user, when logged in, and I create a new post, then the post count
goes up by one (I like speaking in Gherkin). Everything looked OK - but
the post wasn't saving. And there were no useful error messages.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://alexpeattie.com/">Alex Peattie</a> is a hero. He's left Makers
now, but before he did he hacked through what was going on with my
problem. And I mean hacked in the manner of destroying briar patches and
slaying dragons - my mouth dropped in awe as he systematically got to
the source of the problem ("So, let's force it to save&#x2026; it saves the
post fine, but doesn't update the user&#x2026; hmmm&#x2026;"), then started
dropping <code>puts</code> into the DataMapper source code after identifying the
problematic lines in the backtrace.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, it was the password length that was the problem. As the
User was being updated with the new post it is being associated with,
the password requirement (6 letters or more) was kicking in - even when
no password was being submitted with the update. So the post was fine -
just the user didn't, and so prevented the post from saving.
</p>

<p>
Simple to fix (just tell the user model to only validate password length
on creation), but difficult to identify. I won't make that mistake
again, but Alex remains my hero for sorting that out (and giving a great
demonstration debugging). <a href="http://alex-farewell-card.herokuapp.com/">We
all miss him</a>.
