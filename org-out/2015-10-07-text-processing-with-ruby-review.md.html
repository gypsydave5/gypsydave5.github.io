<p>
Plain text is at the root of everything we can do as developers - we
read it, we manipulate it, we write it back out as logs or files or
HTML. We write it as code to do all that, and at the end of the day we
use it to write blog posts like this. Rob Miller's
<a href="https://robm.me.uk/text-processing-with-ruby/"><i>Text Processing with
Ruby</i></a> shows you how to do it as quickly, and elegantly, as possible.
</p>

<p>
A standout feature is the book's use of command line tools. While there
are obviously ways to count the number of lines in a file in Ruby, none
are going to be as quick and as easy as <code>cat file.txt | wc -l</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
The book breaks down and blurs the edges between shell tools, Ruby
scripts and larger, more organised code in a really beautiful way.
</p>

<p>
We're shown tools like <code>cat</code>, <code>grep</code> and <code>cut</code>, and how to interoperate
them with Ruby code written straight into the command line. And as this
builds up we're then shown how to handle standard input and output
inside Ruby programs, allowing us to create our own command line tools
that will play nicely as a part of a pipeline with the rest of the Unix
tool chain.
</p>

<p>
For me this stuff is worth reading the book alone. Leveraging forty
years worth of text tools along side your Ruby code gets more done and
faster. The part of the book that demonstrates how to pipe out of a
process into <code>less</code> to generate paging output was one of the most
amazing things I've seen done in Ruby to date
</p>

<p>
Regular expressions are covered in greater depth than I have seen in
other Ruby books, and with a strong emphasis on their real-world
application. By the time I'd finished these sections I felt like a real
regex ninja.
</p>

<p>
The book also shows how to use Ruby's system variables (the ones
starting with <code>$</code>) to keep regex and other code short. Some people (OK,
my friend Andrea) dislike using anything starting with a <code>$</code> in their
code, and I can see their point as it can look a little esoteric and
obscure. But it felt right to me in the context of this book; maybe
you'd not want to use the system variables in larger, more modular
software, but they're perfect for the short, command line scripts often
used to process text.
</p>

<p>
We're also given a fun tour of parts of Ruby I've not seen - ERB
templating (outside of a web framework), SimpleDelegator - and a few
deep dives on popular text parsing and processing libraries such as the
ever-present Nokogiri and StringScanner. Natural language processing and
fuzzy matching using Phrasie and Text are shown off too.
</p>

<p>
I've found <a href="https://robm.me.uk/text-processing-with-ruby/"><i>Text
Processing with Ruby</i></a> a great exploration of working with text both
inside and outside of Ruby. Reading it has extended my knowledge of Ruby
significantly, while giving me a wealth of new techniques and tools to
use to manipulate text.
</p>

<p>
And that may be the biggest selling point of this book: I can apply it
<i>right away</i> - I am literally using the things I've learned at work
today. Perfect for the beginner to intermediate Rubyist, or any
programmer who wants some standout techniques for handling text whatever
language they're using.

The author gave an interesting example of the power available in
command line tools when I saw him speak at
<a href="http://brightonruby.com/">Brighton Ruby</a>, comparing the
processing speed of Hadoop against a laptop's UNIX tool chain
using small (~2GB) data sets. You can read more about this
comparison on
