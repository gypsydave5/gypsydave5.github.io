<p>
Late in the day yesterday I finally decided that I wanted &#x2014; no, I
needed &#x2014; to install Linux. There are a few reasons for this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can't afford a Mac.</li>
<li>I need to familiarize myself with the *nix CLI.</li>
<li>I'm tired of the grinding noises that Windows 7 makes.</li>
<li>Nobody will buy me a Mac.</li>
<li>I'm also sick of every damn tutorial I read seeming to be geared up or
an OS X or Linux machine.</li>
<li>Excitement and adventure, fortune and glory &#x2014; as always.</li>
<li>And the lack of Mac.</li>
<li>(Seriously, I'm beginning to suspect that Mac envy is a disease&#x2026; I'm
not proud of myself)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The last time I tried to do this was back in around 2005 or 6, when I
was dipping my toes into the open source waters to see what could
happen. And I was relatively underwhelmed. Not only did I have no idea
what I was doing, but there didn't seem to be much to do. I'd installed
watever version of Ubuntu was around on a partition on my old whatever
version of Windows PC. I was impressed that it worked, that it all came
together - but then was left struggling over issues of compatibility of
certain bits of hardware - I remember something to do with the WiFi&#x2026;
and then at the end of it all I still had something which wasn't quite
as good as XP, and I had no reason to stay around.
</p>

<p>
Well, see above for reasons to stay around this time. And how's the
experience second time around? In a word: flawless. I went with
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, threw it onto partition and waited
to see what happened. The installation compared favourably with every
Windows installation I've ever done (a few by now), it reached out to my
home Wifi to update itself, it recommended some packages to install.
Bliss. The interface is prettier that I could ever have imagined.
</p>

<p>
And the other difference from ten years or so ago: applications. There
are actual, genuine, real things for me to use. not just web apps &#x2014;
threw Chrome on pretty sharpish though and everything I have set up
there synchronized neatly &#x2014; but the new versions of LibreOffice look
to be more than enough for what I'll ever need, Dropbox dropped in well
&#x2014; heck, there's even Steam. Steam! It was all I could do not play
Super Hexagon all afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the juiciness of all that fun developer-oriented functionality
that comes out of the box (or just within reach). The command line just
pops up, things run from the command line &#x2014; it's much easier to get my
head around.
</p>

<p>
So if you're a little scared of Linux, or perhaps are a little twice-shy
like I was, don't be. It's a different, and beautiful, beast out there.
</p>

<p>
Now, on to install Rails 4.0.whatever it is right now!

<div class="post-date">16 Sep 2020</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2014-05-01-rails-for-zombies.md.html">Rails for Zombies</a></h1>
<p>
Just been looking at <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a>
again in preparation for my forthcoming interview with
<a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Makers Academy</a> (because it's never too
late and you can always do more).
</p>

<p>
It strikes me what a difference a few months of Ruby and a course
redesign makes. Now when faced with the first set of exercises I wasn't,
as before, struggling to keep up and make sense. Instead I was
interrogating what was going on - "Wait, <code>Zombie.find(1)</code> - what's it
finding? Capital Z&#x2026; is it a class? Let's find out
<code>Zombie.class =&gt; Class</code> - cool, so the tables are represented by
different classes in Ruby&#x2026; what sort of methods does a Zombie have
anyway? <code>Zombie.find(1).methods</code>&#x2026;" and so on.
</p>

<p>
This was great - using the techniques I'd picked up from Ruby Monk and
Ruby Koans to work out for myself what was going on (and not have an
instructor tell me). By the end of the course (and the first part of the
sequel) I had suddenly gained an insight not only into what Rails can
do, but how it does it, and why it does it the way it does. I could also
see what MVC was, not just as a theory but literally in the code - this
is the controller, this is a model.
</p>

<p>
The guys at <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Codeschool</a> have changed the
course since my first attempt at it &#x2014; they describe it as Rails for
Zombies: Redux &#x2014; and it's a huge improvement. Definitely worth a look.
And it's FREE!

<div class="post-date">16 Sep 2020</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2014-07-04-surviving_windows.md.html">Surviving Windows</a></h1>
<p>
I've worked within Windows and Microsoft OSs for&#x2026; well, most of my
computing life now I think about it. I'm pretty sure that most people
are the same. And like most people I've always had my little moans about
it. Too many to mention.
</p>

<p>
This has come to a head since I [switched to Linux][LinuxSwitch] a few
months ago. Not that Linux (Ubuntu in my case) doesn't have it's own
long list of problems, but they all feel more like problems I should be
fixing myself - rather than things I'll just moan about and put up with.
Yes, Ubuntu (and the Unity desktop specfically) has 'spoiled' me. I'd
rather be working in that environment than any earlier version of
Windows. Woo-hoo. Hear the whoop from camp Linux, joy shall be in heaven
over one sinner that repenteth, etc etc usw.
</p>

<p>
But there's still so much of my life that has to be done in Windows.
Work spreadsheet has VBA macros? Work machine in Vista?
<a href="https://launchpad.net/pipelight">Netflix requires Silverlight</a>? It's
inevitable.
</p>

<p>
So instead of moaning I've been trying to fix Windows to make it usable
like I want it to be. And I think I've found some good options. The
first thing to note is that I've been so used to putting up with Windows
that I was under the impression that there was very little that could be
done to it. Lay that thought to rest - there's hundreds of hacks,
options, fixes, and bits of software we can use to make Window's a
happier place to be. Or, if not actively happy, then at least
survivable&#x2026;

<p>
OK, not the greatest name. What I missed most about Ubuntu when stuck on
Vista was the way I could throw windows around the desktop using the
numpad. This feauture is neatly emulated with
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/WinSplit-Revolution/3000-2072_4-10971915.html">Winsplit
Revolution</a>, which is small and, well, works. You can customize the
shortcuts too. (Looks like the original website is no longer around so

<p>
Oh this sounds dumb I know, but nobody even thinks of doing it on
Windows because it's a change. Totally inspired by the Unity set up, it
just makes more sense. If most of what I'm doing involves reading down a
page on the screen - code, text, etc - then I really want optimize the
vertical space on the screen. So slam the taskbar to the side and get
yourself a couple of centimeters for free. If you were going to try one
new thing this week make it this.

could save all those files onto Dropbox, make symlinks to them&#x2026; OK -
too far. But get GVim for Windows.

Install Node! Install everything listed above and more, and get them all
updated from the command line. It's brilliant.
</p>

<p>
Ah, that's it for now. All I'd finish off by saying is that the only
thing holding me back from improving my experience of Windows was&#x2026;
ignorance. And indolence. GNU/Linux makes you change things to fit the
way you work, and as soon as you've learned how to do that it's easier
to avoide complacence with other OSes. . A good lesson.

<p>
Adding to my list of <a href="file:///posts/2014/7/4/surviving-windows/">ways to fix
the Windows experience</a>, I have to pay due respect to
<a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/">Krystoff Kowalcyzk</a>, a developer who has
ported
<a href="http://geoff.greer.fm/2011/12/27/the-silver-searcher-better-than-ack/">Ag
(aka The Silver Surfer)</a> over to Windows. He's also authored a really
elegant (and for elegant please read lightweight and customizable) PDF
viewer
<a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html">SumatraPDF</a>.
Both of these have improved my life today.
</p>

<p>
I've been looking at alternatives to Adobe Reader on the Ubuntu box as
well - currently I'm enjoying the simplicity of
<a href="http://www.mupdf.com/">muPDF</a>, but there are many other options out
there.

<div class="post-date">16 Sep 2020</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2014-07-12-destructuring.md.html">Destructuring in a Method Block</a></h1>
<p>
I went from genius to idiot - very rapidly - when looking at
Enumerable#map and #inject in <a href="https://rubymonk.com/">Ruby Monk</a>, a
free resource to help learn ruby that I've found really useful. Let's
start with 'genius' (although not really genius, more wrong but lucky).
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/44-collections/lessons/98-iterate-filtrate-and-transform#solution4313">question</a>
was as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Exploit the fact that map always returns an array: write a method
<code>hash_keys</code> that accepts a hash and maps over it to return all the
keys in a linear Array.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Exciting, right?
</p>

<p>
The solution that RM gave was this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby"><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">hash_keys</span>(hash)
    hash.map { |pair| pair.first }
<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But I went for:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby"><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">hash_keys</span>(hash)
    hash.map {|key,value| key}
<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Not much difference, but enough. I had become confused when I entered my
code, thinking more about the <code>each_with_index</code> method mentioned in the
same page above. I was forgetting that <code>#map</code> would be sending back a
single value, an array of the key-value pair. Ruby Monk's solution used
that fact to use the method <code>#first</code> on the array, to get the first
element (the key) out.
</p>

<p>
But, by chance, my solution worked - it split the array by telling the
block for map that it would be getting two arguments - checking with the
good people on the #ruby channel on IRC (a chap called bannisterfiend to
be precise), this is
<a href="http://tony.pitluga.com/2011/08/08/destructuring-with-ruby.html"><i>destructuring</i></a>,
binding a set of values to a corresponding set of values that you can
normally bind to a single variable (that's the definition as given in
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node252.html">Common
Lisp</a>, but makes sense here).
</p>

<p>
What we're seeing is this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">x, y = [1,2]
x <span style="color: #d9d9d9;"># </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">=&gt; 1</span>
y <span style="color: #d9d9d9;"># </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">=&gt; 2</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But done as a loop for all the arrays pulled out of the hash by <code>#map</code>.
Tony Pitluga sings the praises of destructuring block arguments (which
is what this is) in his longer article on
<a href="http://tony.pitluga.com/2011/08/08/destructuring-with-ruby.html">destructuring
in Ruby</a>.
</p>

<p>
There's an improvement in the semantics of the method (would you rather
have <code>key</code> or <code>pair.first</code>?) and a saving of writing/time in any later
work you might want to do on the values. Of course, we wouldn't want to
do this to longer arrays - too many elements to bind to values.
</p>

<p>
Unless we used the 'unarray' or, 'star' or (best name evar)
<a href="http://endofline.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/the-strange-ruby-splat/">splat
operator</a> to collect some of the other elements.
</p>

<p>
Consider:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">x, *y = [1,2,3,4,5,6j
x <span style="color: #d9d9d9;"># </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">=&gt; 1</span>
y <span style="color: #d9d9d9;"># </span><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">=&gt; [2,3,4,5,6]</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There's a lot more on the magic of the splat in the second edition of
<a href="http://www.manning.com/black2/">The Well Rounded Rubyist</a> which has
just been published (and which I'm enjoying immensely).
</p>

<p>
OK, I'll write up my other mistake (the one that broke the <code>#map</code> block)
later in the week.
</p>

<p>
PS - noticed when getting links for this post that Ruby 2.0 introduces
the double-splat operator for
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18289152/what-does-double-splat-operators-do-in-ruby">turning
keyword-value pairs in argument lists into a hash</a>. Which is also
exciting.
