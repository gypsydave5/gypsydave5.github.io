<p>
/Update: while this is a good template to do a quick backup, a more
flexible solution exists in the
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle">Brew Bundle</a> project.
Thanks [@MacHomebrew](<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle</a>) for
the pointer!/
</p>

<p>
It's a good idea to keep track of what packages you've got installed in
Homebrew - good for provisioning a new Mac, good for recovering from a
disaster.
</p>

<p>
To get a list of the current packages is as simple as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">brew ls
</pre>
</div>

<p>
but that gives us everything, dependencies and all. If we just want what
we explicitly installed, we should go for
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">brew leaves
</pre>
</div>

<p>
like the leaves of our dependency tree.
</p>

<p>
Just pipe that out into a file
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">brew leaves &gt; homebrew-packages.txt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
for safekeeping and get it under version control along with the rest of
you configuration files.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to recovery, we can save time and effort by using <code>xargs</code>
to pipe out each of the lines as an argument to <code>brew install</code>
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">cat homebrew-packages.txt | xargs brew install
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and everything will (re)install in one go. It may take some time.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you want to add to the list from one machine without overwriting
the current list? I just did (for one reason or another), and it's
fairly easy to handle. Instead of overwriting the text file, append to
the end of it
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">brew leaves &gt;&gt; homebrew-packages.txt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now you might have some repetitions in that file - get rid of them with
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">sort homebrew-packages.txt | uniq
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This sorts the original list into order, then removes any lines that are
repetitions of the one before, leaving only one. Pipe that out to a new
file
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">sort homebrew-packages.txt | uniq &gt; homebrew-packages-reconciled.txt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and overwrite the old one if you need to (just don't do it in the pipe -
it doesn't like it and the file becomes blank. Boo.)
</p>

<p>
Did I mention that
<a href="file:///posts/2015/10/7/text-processing-with-ruby-by-rob-miller/">Text
Processing with Ruby</a> was an amazing book? I worked out how to do the
above from what I read in the section on Unix tools. Nice.
