<p>
Maybe this story is familiar to you: you're working away, hotshot
terminal user that you are. You're a pretty fast typist - not the
<i>fastest</i> for sure, but you're confident. Confident&#x2026; but not always
super accurate.
</p>

<p>
So you're hacking away, moving in and out of directories with <code>cd</code> (and
then immediately typing <code>ls</code> because that's what you do), except this
time you slip and instead of typing <code>cd</code> you somehow typed <code>dc</code>.
</p>

<p>
And then this happens:
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ dc
</pre>

<p>
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Now the faint of heart would, at this
point, give up. Perhaps a quick <code>^C</code> to make the problem goes away&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But <i>you</i> are made of bolder stuff! Let me assure you that you've struck
<i>gold</i>! Ancient wisdom, layed down by the wise Unix masters for us to
find. <code>dc</code> comes from a noble heritage, holds many secrets, and has much
to teach us. Come! Come with me friends! Let us explore the wonders of
<code>dc</code>.
</p>

<p>
But first&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; what is <code>dc</code>?
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1abd44f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="dc-your-friendly-neighbourhood-reverse-polish-desk-calculator"><code>dc</code>, Your Friendly Neighbourhood Reverse Polish Desk Calculator</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-dc-your-friendly-neighbourhood-reverse-polish-desk-calculator">
<p>
<code>dc</code> is a <i>desk calculator</i>, as opposed to a <i>pocket</i> calculator<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
or a computer. In fact, when <code>dc</code> was first written there really weren't
very many pocket calculators: it was 1969.
</p>

<p>
(At this point feel free to cosplay a little to get you in the mood.
Wear an afghan coat, put some flowers in your hair, listen to Jefferson
Airplane, drop a little acid, stare at a mandala, or, whatever, man&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
So it's a desk calculator. So I can do sums with it, right?
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ dc
2 + 3
dc: stack empty
</pre>

<p>
eh?
</p>

<p>
<code>dc</code> is a <i>reverse Polish</i> desk calculator; it uses Reverse Polish
Notation (RPN). What's Reverse Polish Notation you ask? Well, it's like
Polish Notation only backwards.
</p>

<p>
Sorry, sorry - it's an easy joke to make, which is why I made it.
</p>

<p>
Polish Notation is also known as <i>prefix notation</i>. Instead of all the
mathematical operators like <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>
<code>appearing in between the numbers (infix notation -=2 +
3</code>), in Polish notation they appear at the beginning (=+ 2 3`).
</p>

<p>
The genius of Polish notation is that _it doesn't require parentheses or
operator prescedence to organise an expression.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> Let me
demonstrate: take the sum (in infix notation), <code>2 * (3 + 5)</code>. We know
the answer to be <code>16</code>. But if we shift the parentheses <code>(2 * 3) + 5</code> we
get <code>11</code> instead. To make the expression unambiguous we need the
parentheses to show which numbers belong to which operator.
</p>

<p>
But in Polish Notation we can do the same <i>without</i> the parentheses. The
first expression becomes <code>* 2 + 3 5</code>; the second <code>+ * 2 3 5</code>.
</p>

<p>
Seems a bit funny, doesn't it? The way to think of it is that, everytime
you introduce a new operator like <code>+</code> or <code>*</code>, you start waiting for
enough nubers to arrive on the right hand side for the operator to be
applied.
</p>

<p>
For the first sum we start with <code>*</code>, we then get a <code>2</code> - so whatever
comes next is going to get multiplied by <code>2</code>. But what's next is a <code>+</code> -
so now we have to wait for the <code>+</code> to get enough numbers given to it for
it to become a number. Happily we get a <code>3</code> and a <code>5</code>, so the <code>+</code> turns
out to be a <code>8</code>, which we can then immediately multiply by <code>2</code>.
</p>

<p>
So that's Polish Notation - think of each operator as 'waiting around'
for enough input from the right to do something&#x2026; and then - 'YOMP!' -
it eats the input and becomes a result.
</p>

<p>
Reverse Polish Notation works in exactly the same way, <i>only backwards</i>.
This is what our two sums would look like in RPN: <code>2 3 5 + *</code> (which
evaluates to <code>16</code>), and <code>2 3 * 5 +</code> (which evaluates to <code>11</code>).
</p>

<p>
Instead of each operator waiting for new things on the right, they 'eat
up' things that have already appeared on the left. Looking at the first
sum again, we 'serve up' a <code>2</code>, then a <code>3</code>, then a <code>5</code>. Then a <code>+</code>
appears; it eats the two numbers closest to it on the left - the <code>3</code> and
<code>5</code> - and becomes an <code>8</code>. Then the <code>*</code> appears at the end. It also eats
the two numbers closest to it on the left - which are now a <code>2</code> and the
new <code>8</code>, and spits out the answer, <code>16</code>.
</p>

<p>
Think of the numbers on the right being left on a plate in a row. An
operator turns up on the right and - YOMP! - it eats as many inputs as
it needs and becomes a result (and joins the delicious numbers on the
plate).
</p>

<p>
So we can perform arithmetic in Reverse Polish Notation with <code>dc</code>. Try
it! Type in <code>3 5 +</code> and hit return!
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ dc
3 5 +
</pre>

<p>
Ummm&#x2026; still nothing. Did we break it? Did we do something wrong? No,
there's just one snag: the result is still 'on the plate' - to see it we
need to print it out with the command <code>p</code>. Type it in and hit return
again:
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ dc
3 5 +
p
8
</pre>

<p>
Amazing!
</p>

<p>
Now, here's the next amazing thing: you don't have to type out your sum
all in one go; you can put each number on the plate in order, then send
in an operator to consume them. So we can write the above <code>dc</code>
calculation as:
</p>

<pre class="example">
3
5
+
p
8
</pre>

<p>
hitting return after each line until it prints an <code>8</code> for us.
</p>

<p>
Next fun fact: the <code>8</code> is still on the plate, waiting for us to go on.
So we can keep going with our calculation even after we've printed it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
3
5
+
p
8
2
*
p
16
</pre>

<p>
And there we have it - building up a calculation by pushing things on to
a <i>stack</i> - because that's what this plate really is - and then pulling
them off every time we perform an operation.
</p>

<p>
<code>dc</code> isn't just a calculator - it belongs to a family of <i>stack based
programming languages</i>.
</p>

<h2 id="stack-based-programming">Stack Based Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-stack-based-programming">
<p>
We're used to programming using <i>variables</i>, as arguments to functions
and as the subject of operations. We add two numbers - assign the result
to a variable. We return values from functions. We maintain the 'state'
of our program either through keeping it in variables, or passing it
around as an argument to functions. No really.
</p>

<p>
In stack based programming, the state is ever present as a stack. You
call a function - it takes the stack, does something with a number of
its values by <code>popping</code> them off the end, and then <code>pushes</code> some values
on again. There are no 'arguments', there is no 'result', there are no
'variables'. There's just this one beautiful stack representing the
state and progress of your program.
</p>

<p>
Even if you're used to programming in different styles and paradigms,
stack based programming is pretty freaky. It blows your mind a little
bit - and that's fun. It's also <i>ridiculously terse</i> - because there's
no assignment going on, or function arguments being bound, all you're
seeing are pure functions being applied to the stack. For instance,
here's a 'simple' pallindrome detector written in the language
Factor:<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<pre class="example">
: palindrome? ( string -- ? ) dup reverse = ;
</pre>

<p>
Breaking it down, we have
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>palindrome?</code> is the name of the function</li>
<li><code>( string -- ? )</code> is the function signature - it takes a string from
the stack and puts on a boolean - <code>?</code></li>
<li><code>dup</code> duplicates the value on the stack</li>
<li><code>reverse</code> reverses the first string on the stack in place</li>
<li><code>=</code> takes two values off the stack and puts on a boolean, true if
they're equal, false otherwise</li>
<li>and <code>;</code> is the end of the function!</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-bc-dcs-younger-better-looking-more-successful-brother">
<p>
Now it's possible that, even after this <i>amazing</i> introduction to stack
based programming and Reverse Polish Notation, you're still not
<i>completely</i> in love with the idea of the <code>+</code> coming at the end of
adding two numbers up. And I can totally understand that.
</p>

<p>
So you'll be happy to learn that your needs were catered for by the
creation of <code>bc</code> - which is just <code>dc</code> but with infix notation. <code>1 + 1</code>
really will add up to <code>2</code> in <code>bc</code> (but it's a little more complicated to
use - have a read of the <code>man</code> page).

<code>dc</code> had its fifteen minutes of fame when it was used as part of the
one-line implementation of the RSA algorithm in the late 90s. The US
government had, in its infinite wisdom, passed a law to restrict the
publication and sharing of cryptographic tools - including algorithms.
Hacker types weren't too pleased about this - it was essentially making
maths illegal - and so they took to
<a href="http://www.cypherspace.org/rsa/">sharing RSA in some fairly inventive
ways</a>: putting it on ties etc.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Here it is:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-perl">print pack<span style="color: #666666;">"C*"</span>,split<span style="color: #666666;">/\D+/</span>,<span style="color: #666666;">`echo "16iII*o\U@{$/=$z;[(pop,pop,unpack"H*",&lt;&gt;</span>
<span style="color: #666666;">)]}\EsMsKsN0[lN*1lK[d2%Sa2/d0&lt;X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0&lt;J]dsJxp"|dc`</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Fairly hard to spot it, but the <code>|dc</code> at the end is taking the input
before and piping it into <code>dc</code>. Quite incredible for a program that's
fifty years old.
