<p>
Bad times - having to connect to my company's SQL Server database in
order to migrate data. The last time I looked at that database it was
through a connection to a Windows box running the Microsoft development
client. Laggy, slow, and an unfamiliar environment.
</p>

<p>
So what are my options on a Mac? Well, there are a couple of SQL Server
clients out there, but the one I tried out turned out to be buggy -
there's nothing less fun than losing a query you've been crafting for an
hour. And why should I spend time moving the query betweeen an editor
(Vi) and an awkward GUI interface?
</p>

<p>
Screw that - let's do it in Vim! This method has been tested on my Mac,
but should also work for another *nix based system. No guarantees
though.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc517ca1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="the-tools">The Tools</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the-tools">
<p>
To do this we need:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a way for the Mac to talk to the SQL Server database</li>
<li>a way for that connection to talk to Vim</li>
</ul>

<p>
And we will be using the following tools to do that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.freetds.org/">FreeTDS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.unixodbc.com/">unixODBC</a></li>
<li>the Vim plugin
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=356">dbext.vim</a></li>
<li>and the Perl libraries <a href="http://dbi.perl.org/">DBI</a> and
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mjevans/DBD-ODBC-1.52/ODBC.pm">DBD::ODBC</a>
(installed using
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mjevans/DBD-ODBC-1.52/ODBC.pm">CPAN</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
We'll start with a simple example - connecting dbext to a local instance
of PostgreSQL.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org138a50b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="dbext-with-postgresql">dbext with PostgreSQL</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-dbext-with-postgresql">
<p>
Install dbext into Vim using whichever package manager or other you
like. Dbext is a 'proper' Vim extension, in that it comes with extensive
documentation in the form of Vim helpfiles. Access the full help with
<code>:h dbext</code> and check out the tutorial at <code>:h dbext-tutorial</code>.
</p>

<p>
If even the tutorial is fast enough, here's a quick start for PostgreSQL
locally. Let's assume you've already installed PostgreSQL, and that
you've not added any usernames or passwords. Somewhere in your Vim
initialization files (like <code>~/.vimrc</code>) add the following line:
</p>

<p>
<code>let g:dbext_default_profile_local_PSQL = 'type=PGSQL'</code>
</p>

<p>
Here we've set up a local profile for PostgreSQL, called it
<code>local_PSQL</code>, and told dbext that the type of connection this profile
will use is, well, Postgres. Now either restart Vim or evaluate that
command in your current session.
</p>

<p>
To use this profile with some SQL in Vim, first put some SQL into a
buffer. Try this: <code>SELECT * FROM bob</code>. Then, in the buffer, send the
command <code>:DBPromptForBufferParameters</code>. You'll get a menu with the
<code>local_PSQL</code> option on it. Select that option (probably option 1).
</p>

<p>
Now have a crack at running a query - put your cursor on the line with
the SQL statement on it and execute the query with the command
<code>&lt;Leader&gt;sel</code> (=s=ql =e=xecute =l=ine).
</p>

<p>
This won't work, but should give you a hint about what's going wrong:
PostgreSQL needs a <code>[.pgpass]</code> file for the password to the database -
even if there isn't a password(!). So just create an empty file called
<code>.pgpass</code> in your <code>$HOME</code> directory. Now it should work (or at least
return a reasonable error message if your default database doesn't have
a <code>bob</code> table).
</p>

<p>
Now&#x2026; go crazy! Dbext is great - read some of the docs in full and have
a play with some SQL queries. Ah, the joy of Vim! Come back when you
want to hook it up to a remote SQL Server.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sql-server-on-mac">
<p>
Had fun? Right, this bit is a bit of a drag. Macs (and other *nix
systems) have no native support for TDS, the protocol by which we talk
to SQL Server databases. So we'll have to install a library called
<code>freetds</code>.
</p>

<p>
But before we do that we'll need to install an ODBC driver as the
<code>freetds</code> library does not provide sufficiently sophisticated binaries
for <code>dbext</code> to use to query a database directly.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
First up we'll install <code>unixodbc</code> - I'm using
<a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, but if you'd like to build your own
binaries be my guest.
</p>

<pre class="example">
brew install unixodbc
</pre>

<p>
And now that's done, let's get hold of <code>freetds</code>
</p>

<pre class="example">
brew install freetds --with-unixodbc --with-msdblib
</pre>

<p>
We're asking for <code>freetds</code> to be installed with <code>unixodbc</code> support, and
telling it that we want it to use the version of TDS that Microsoft
developed for SQL Server.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to test the installation, <code>freetds</code> comes with a couple of
command line tools you can use to connect to a SQL Server DB. Run <code>tsql</code>
with the appropriate server, port, username and password passed in as
options and check to see if you can connect. Have a bit more of a play
around if you can - you've earned it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3827af5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="perl-dbi-and-dbdodbc">Perl: <code>DBI</code> and <code>DBD::ODBC</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-perl-dbi-and-dbdodbc">
<p>
The final step is to get <code>dbext</code> talking to the ODBC installation. And
it wants to do this through a pair of Perl libraries. We'll install
these using CPAN, the Perl equivalent of RubyGems or NPM.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> First
start the interactive interface as the super user:
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
</pre>

<p>
And then install the libraries we need:
</p>

<pre class="example">
install DBI
install DBD::ODBC
</pre>

<p>
Both of these will output a scarily verbose amount of logs - it's ok,
it's normal<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> - and by the end of it we've got everything installed
that we'll need. Almost there. Almost&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2f09f67" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="configuration-files">Configuration files</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-configuration-files">
<p>
Getting <code>freetds</code> and <code>unixodbc</code> working together happily is super
simple - but it took me a while to work out exactly what was needed.
Configuration for <code>freetds</code> can live either in its own configuration
file, or with the ODBC configuration. The simplest thing to do is to
push the configuration over to the ODBC side entirely.
</p>

<p>
What we're looking to do it to tell ODBC that there is a sort of
database called 'freeTDS' and to point it to where the files that
describe the protocol live - this is the database 'driver', just like a
printer driver. Then we need to give ODBC the details of the specific
database we want to connect to - think of this as the specific printer
you connect to using a printer driver, the network address etc.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to register <code>freetds</code> as a driver with <code>unixodbc</code> -
this is done in a file called <code>odbcinst.ini</code> which Homebrew has
(hopefully) symlinked into <code>/usr/local/etc/odbcinst.ini</code><sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>. And in
that file we put the following:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[FreeTDS]
Description = TD Driver (MSSQL)
Driver = /usr/local/lib/libtdsodbc.so
Setup = /usr/local/lib/libtdsodbc.so
FileUsage = 1
</pre>

<p>
The top line is the name we're giving the driver, the second a
human-friendly description of what it does. Thee next two lines give
ODBC the driver and set up information - <code>libsdsodbc.so</code> was installed
with the <code>freeTDS</code> installation and put in <code>/usr/local/lib</code> as a symlink
by Homebrew (again, hopefully).
</p>

<p>
That's the driver bit done. Now let's point ODBC to your SQL Server
database by adding its details to the <code>~/.odbc.ini</code> file, which you'll
have to create.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> Put the following in there:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[MyMSSQLDB]
Driver = FreeTDS
Server = &lt;ip or domain name goes here&gt;
Database = &lt;database name goes here&gt;
Port = &lt;port number&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This connection information is called a DSN<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>, and we'll be using it
in <code>dbext</code>. Replace <code>MyMSSQLDB</code> with something more descriptive - it's
the name of the connection to your database that ODBC (and, by
extension, <code>dbext</code>) will use.
</p>

<p>
Success! One more small step to go
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge6617f4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="odbc-in-dbext">ODBC in <code>dbext</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-odbc-in-dbext">
<p>
Now we've got an ODBC connection to play with, it's time to put its
details into <code>dbext</code>. This can bedone by putting the following into your
<code>.vimrc</code> - right next to where you declared your PostgreSQL connection
information.
</p>

<p>
<code>let g:dbext_default_profile_MyMSSQLDB = 'type=ODBC:user=&lt;username&gt;:passwd=&lt;password&gt;:dsnname=MyMSSQLDB'</code><sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Pretty long, right? But comprehendible. We're giving similar information
to that which we used for the PostgreSQL connection, only we're
declaring that the type is <code>ODBC</code>, and we're declaring the DSN name that
we're using as well.
</p>

<p>
And that's it. Restart your Vim Session, <code>&lt;Leader&gt;sbp</code> (it's the same as
<code>:DBPromptForBufferParameters</code>) and pick MyMSSQLDB (feel free to give it
a better name later). You can now evaluate lines of SQL against the
database, and see the return value in a separate split below.
