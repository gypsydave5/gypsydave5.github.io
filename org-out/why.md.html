<p>
One of the goals of computer programming is to provide the user of our
software with a good <i>abstraction</i>; we don't want our web browsers to be
forcing us to think about HTTP requests, we want to click links and see
pages. We don't want to know how an object is created in memory in
JavaScript, we just want to use it to display cat videos in our browser.
</p>

<p>
But often we're exposed to some of the hideous truths buried beneath our
comfortable abstractions. Perhaps because of an error in our code. Or
because we're having to work with our computers at a more fundamental
level. Or it's because some clever sod decided that all the user
entitlements would be modelled using a bit mask.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Anyway, this is an article about bits, bytes and binary. It's also about
octal and hexadecimal, but that doesn't make for as catchy a title.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc90d58f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-who-is-this-for">
<p>
This is for any software developer, but will probably be of most use to
those who (like me) do not have a computer science background. It would
be helpful if they have some experience of using a Unix-like system
(OSX, Linux), and of writing colours in CSS. But this is not necessary.
</p>

<p>
The focus is on understanding the meaning of a bit and a byte, and on
reading and understanding binary, octal and hexidecimal numbers. The
skills developed are meant to be practical; they are applicable to a
wide range of subjects that are encountered by a software developer:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>file permissions</li>
<li>IP addresses and networking</li>
<li>Reading stack traces</li>
<li>CSS colours</li>
</ul>

<p>
We will not examine less applicatble topics like binary arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Oh and it might be fun in a geeky kinda way.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-a-bit">
<p>
What's a bit? It's fundamentally a pun - a contraction of the words
<i>binary digit</i>. A bit is a digit in <i>binary</i>. Let's get back to bits in
a minute - what's binary?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge2f084d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="binary">Binary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-binary">
<p>
You can count - I'm assuming you can count. In the decimal counting
system using Arab numerals - the counting system that's been popular in
Western Europe (and then the rest of the world) since the
Renaissance,<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> there are ten digits:
</p>

<pre class="example">
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
</pre>

<p>
When we represent <i>any</i> number in decimal, we use these numerals. But we
don't just write them in any order; the position of each numeral tell us
how many of a power of ten goes in to make the number.
</p>

<p>
For instance
</p>

<pre class="example">
1337
</pre>

<p>
Is a number made up of
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>one lot of the third power of ten - 'ten to the three' - a thousand</li>
<li>three lots of the second power of ten - 'ten to the two' - three
hundreds</li>
<li>three lots of the first power of ten - 'ten to the one'- three tens</li>
<li>and seven lots of the zeroth power of ten - 'ten to the zero' - seven
ones</li>
</ul>

<p>
It might seem a bit odd to think of the final digit representing <code>n</code>
lots of the zeroth power of ten, but I hope you can see how it fits in
with the rest of the digits. This is probably how you've been counting
for most of your life, but probably without thinking of each of the
digits as representing a count of a power of ten.
</p>

<p>
But why represent numbers using ten digits?<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> Why not, say, two?
</p>

<pre class="example">
0 1
</pre>

<p>
And so we have <i>binary</i>, a number system based on using two digits to
represent every number. Each digit in a binary number represents a
<i>power of two</i>, just as every digit in a decimal number represented a
<i>power of ten</i>.
</p>

<p>
So
</p>

<pre class="example">
1101
</pre>

<p>
Means
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>one lot of the third power of two (1 * 2<sup>3</sup> = 1 * 8 = 8)</li>
<li>one lotof the second power of two (1 * 2<sup>2</sup> = 1 * 4 = 4)</li>
<li>zero lots of thefirst power of two (0 * 2<sup>1</sup> = 0 * 2 = 0)</li>
<li>and one lot of the zeroth power of two (1 * 2<sup>0</sup> = 1 * 1 = 1)</li>
</ul>

<p>
So the number represented by <code>1101</code> is 8 + 4 + 1 &#x2013; it's 13
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1c36649" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="back-to-the-bits">Back to the Bits</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-back-to-the-bits">
<p>
So now we have an answer to the question 'what is a bit?' - it's a
binary digit, or in other words it's a <code>0</code> or a <code>1</code>. Actually, why is it
either of those symbols? We could choose anything - we could use üôÇ and
üôÉ, or üëç and üëé, or <i>anything</i> we like. Remember, it's just a
<i>representation</i> of a number - it's not actually a number itself.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Now, inside your computer, at any one time, everything that's going on
is kept as a series of high- and low-voltage ???registers??? in memory
and (solid state) disk. We use these many millions of ???boxes with
voltages in??? to represent <i>everything</i> that we ever do on a computer.
</p>

<p>
And when we represent these voltages, we do so as binary digits - as
bits. We say the low-voltage ???box??? is <code>0</code> and the high voltage
???box??? is <code>1</code>. This, if you like, is the original abstraction of all
computing - the moment it stops being elecronic engineering and becomes
something else - we can stop thinking about the hardware and start
thinking about&#x2026; bits.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgda10f33" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="practical-one-integers">Practical one: integers</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-practical-one-integers">
<p>
It probably won't surprise you that one of the easiest things to encode
into bits are integers - whole numbers. We've pretty much done it above.
So we know that the number
</p>

<pre class="example">
1101
</pre>

<p>
is thirteen.
</p>

<p>
But how do we write <i>negative</i> integers? We can't just write
</p>

<pre class="example">
-1101
</pre>

<p>
because all we have to play with is =0=s and =1=s? The obvious answer is
to just use a zero or one to mark a number as being positive or
negative. So we could have <code>0</code> means positive, and <code>1</code> means negative,
giving us
</p>

<pre class="example">
01101
</pre>

<p>
for thirteen and
</p>

<pre class="example">
11101
</pre>

<p>
for minus thirteen.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
But it doesn't take a genius to see a problem here: how can we tell the
difference between <code>11101</code> as "minus thirteen" and <code>11101</code> as
"twenty-nine" - which is what we'd get if we counted that first <code>1</code> as
one lot of two to the power of four (sixteen) - ?
</p>

<p>
This is an example of a bigger problem: when do we stop reading the
bits? What tells us - or the computer - that this bit is the end of a
number (or a character, or a string, or a an object) and the next one is
the beginning of another?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd5f1d8c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="bytes">Bytes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-bytes">
<p>
This is where <i>bytes</i> come in. A byte is a collection of bits - yes,
this is definitely a pun about biting things. In every computer you will
come across a byte is made up of <i>eight</i> bits:<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>
</p>

<pre class="example">
10101010
</pre>

<p>
or
</p>

<pre class="example">
11111111
</pre>

<p>
A byte gives us a way of knowing when to stop - think of it like a word
in a natural language; if all the letters were mushed together without
spaces we'd find it hard to know when one word stopped and the next one
began.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
So now we can store unsigned integers (without a plus or a minus sign)
in a byte. Hooray! We can successfully count all the way up to&#x2026;
two-hundred and fifty-five. Well, that sucks, as I'm pretty sure I can
think of bigger numbers. This is why we can use more than one byte when
we're representing a number.
</p>

<p>
If we use two bytes
</p>

<pre class="example">
11111111 11111111
</pre>

<p>
We can get up to sixty-five thousand five hundred and thirty-five. Don't
trust me - go and count for yourself. I'll wait.
</p>

<p>
Throw another two bytes at the problem
</p>

<pre class="example">
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111
</pre>

<p>
And we can reach the heady heights of&#x2026; 4294967295. Which is a very big
number.
</p>

<p>
I'll let you in to a trick: the biggest number that you can represent
using binary is 2<sup>n</sup> -1, where n is the number of digits in your number.
So I calculated the above number by working out 2<sup>16</sup> - 1. Don't worry: I
didn't use my fingers&#x2026;<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Great, so now we can calculate big numbers, and we know when to stop
reading the numbers - we just need to know how many bytes they're made
of. But what about those pesky negative integers? How do we know whether
</p>

<pre class="example">
11111111
</pre>

<p>
is two-hundred and fifty-five or minus one-hundred and twenty-seven?
</p>

<p>
This is why computers - and computer programming languages - have
<i>types</i>. Yes, there are other reasons to have types - please, Haskell
programmers, don't have a fit. But this is the most general case A type
will tell you not only how many bytes a 'thing' takes up in memory, but
also what sort of a thing it is. So if you know that <i>those</i> four bytes
over there are a signed integer:
</p>

<pre class="example">
10000000 00000000 00000000 00000100
</pre>

<p>
Then you know that it's the number -4. But if it's an <i>unsigned</i> integer
then it's the number 2147483652. And if it's a floating point number, or
a string, or perhaps an object&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
A lot of programming languages do you, me and everyone else the
significant service of hiding all of this from our eyes - Ruby will
automatically turn one size of integer into another size of integer when
it gets too big to be stored in a certain number of bytes. Other
languages side step the issue by having only <i>one</i> type for all numbers;
JavaScript uses a 64 bit double precision float for every number.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Some programming languages - usually lower level ones - will tell you
<i>exactly</i> how much space in memory one of your values is taking up,
which can give a programmer more control over the amount of memory the
program is using. In Rust, for instance, you can have a <code>uint32</code> - an
unsigned, thirty-two bit integer. That information, combined with what
we've learned above, gives us enough information to know
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that the value takes up four bytes (32 / 8 = 4)</li>
<li>that the maximum value of a <code>uint32</code> is 4294967295 (2 ^ 32 - 1)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes this is useful, sometimes it's not. But it's always good to
know.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1e0e4cf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="not-just-binary-1-css-and-hexadecimal">Not just binary 1: CSS and Hexadecimal</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-just-binary-1-css-and-hexadecimal">
<p>
Binary 'thinking' leaks out of lower level programs and out into the way
we write things that, on the face of it, really shouldn't be related.
For instance, one of the first things I ever wrote as a program probably
looked something like
</p>

<pre class="example">
body {
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
}
</pre>

<p>
Yes, CSS! What the hell were all the Fs about? Why on earth was that
<i>white</i>? I remember experimenting with different values to see what
worked and what didn't - the joy of programming!
</p>

<p>
What's weird is that one of the first things we do in simple web
programming turns out to be a great example of binary numbers making a
surprise appearance. You see, <code>FFFFFF</code> is actually a twenty-four bit
number, represented in <i>hexadecimal</i> notation.
</p>

<p>
Hexadecimal is just counting in base sixteen ('hexa' like six, as in
hexagon, 'decimal' like ten - it's Greek&#x2026;). Now when we used binary we
got rid of a lot of digits - everything that wasn't <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>. But for
base sixeteen we need another six digits to make the total up to
sixteen. So we just start counting using letters! <code>A</code> is ten, <code>B</code> is
eleven and so on up to <code>F</code> being fifteen.
</p>

<p>
So we can count up to twenty like this (starting at zero, naturally):
</p>

<pre class="example">
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
A
B
C
D
E
F
10
11
12
13
14
</pre>

<p>
Big woop. So what? Why on earth would you use a base of sixteen when
you've got decimal - everybody's favourite and universally popular?
</p>

<p>
Hexadecimal is useful because it <i>plays nicely with binary</i>. Sounds
weird, right? Let me explain: because sixteen is the fourth power of two
('two to the four'), each hexadecimal digit can represent <i>four</i> binary
digits - with no carry over.
</p>

<p>
When we represent a binary number in decimal we can never be sure how
many binary digits will be used for one decimal digit.
</p>

<pre class="example">
1001
</pre>

<p>
becomes
</p>

<pre class="example">
9
</pre>

<p>
only one digit
</p>

<pre class="example">
1010
</pre>

<p>
becomes
</p>

<pre class="example">
10
</pre>

<p>
two digits!
</p>

<p>
But because the first four bits in a binary number are for all numbers
from zero to fifteen, they map perfectly on to a single hexadecimal
digit.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup>

</ul>

<p>
This demonstrates another useful aspect of hexadecimal: writing fun
messages.
</p>

<p>
So hexadecimal is really good at representing known 'blocks' of binary
information - four bits to each hexadecimal digit.
</p>

<p>
And if there are two digits, then there are eight bits&#x2026; it's a byte!
So what we're seeing here is a three byte - twenty-four bit - number,
written out in hexadecimal notation.
</p>

<p>
But&#x2026; why do this for a <i>colour</i>?
</p>

<p>
Each of those bytes represents a component of the colour being
described - red, green and blue. So by writin it out in hexadecimal you
get some visual indication of when each element begins and ends - it's
two hex digits - and you also know that the length of the number will
always be six digits. And it's one hell of a lot easier to read than it
would be in decimal (0 to 16777215 anyone&#x2026;?).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-just-binary-2-file-permissions-and-octal">
<p>
The other number system that comes up with some regularity (although
less than hexidecimal) is <i>octal</i>, which uses eight as the base. Again,
this base is no accident; a single octal digit can represent <i>three</i>
bits:
</p>

<pre class="example">
        |          |          |          |
-       | :-:      | :-:      | :-:      | :-:

decimal | 45       | 54       | 18       | 63
octal   | 55       | 66       | 22       | 77
</pre>

<p>
A single octal digit can represent numbers from 0 to 7, and two of them
can represent numbers from 0 to 63.
</p>

<p>
One of the strangest, but also most interesting, uses of octal is in
representing file permissions in Unix. If you're in front of a Linux or
Mac computer right now, open a terminal session and type <code>ls -l</code>. You
should see something like this:

The column on the right represents the <i>file permissions</i> for each file.
The first character shows whether its a directory (a <code>d</code>), and the other
nine show =r=ead, =w=rite and e=x=ecute permissions for the owner, the
owner's group and everyone else.
</p>

<p>
So if a directory could be read, written and executed by the owner it
would say
</p>

<pre class="example">
drwx------
</pre>

<p>
And if a file could be read by everyone
</p>

<pre class="example">
-r--r--r--
</pre>

<p>
Fun times.
</p>

<p>
But we don't really need the letters - the position of the flags give us
all the information we need. If we say that <code>0</code> represents disabled, and
<code>1</code> represents enabled, and ignoring the directory flag, we could write
the file permission above as
</p>

<pre class="example">
100100100
</pre>

<p>
Oh hey look - a binary number!
</p>

<p>
Now look at the repeating pattern - it goes Read, Write and Execute
three times. We could break this up into groups of three bits:
</p>

<pre class="example">
100 100 100
</pre>

<p>
But after our brush with hexidecimal we know that each of those groups
of three binary numerals can be written as a single octal numeral:
</p>

<pre class="example">
444
</pre>

<p>
For that one, but for the directory that can only be used by the owner:
</p>

<pre class="example">
700
</pre>

<p>
These magic octal file permission numbers come up <i>disturbingly</i> often -
more often than you'd think was necessary in the twenty first century.
For instance, exciting modern programming language Go
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/#FileMode">needed to model file
permissions</a>, it did so by using as 32 bit <i>number</i> where the nine
'least significant bits' (i.e.¬†the end of the number) represented
<code>rwxrwxrwx</code> permissions as above. The same occurs in Python, and
<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_modes">NodeJS</a>.
</p>

<p>
Treating numbers as flags has some exciting - or gnarly - side effects.
For instance, if you wanted to make creating permissions a bit more
readable you could do something like
</p>

<pre class="example">
owner_read = 0400
owner_write = 0200
group_read = 0040
other_read = 0004

permission = owner_read + owner_write + group_read + other_read // =&gt; 0644
</pre>

<p>
Which reads better - but we don't want to do this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
permission = other_read + other_read + other_read // =&gt; 0020 - group write!
</pre>

<p>
But there <i>is</i> a way around this - we can use a special set of operators
that work on numbers <i>at the bit</i> level, treating each bit as a boolean
flag.

Look, I'm not sure I should be telling you this - it's pretty low level
and nasty. But we've come this far and we can't turn back now.
</p>

<p>
So you're used to booleans when you're programming - things like <code>True</code>
and <code>False</code> - and the operations that we can perform on them - things
like <i>and</i> and <i>or</i>. They probably look something like this in your
language (this is in Ruby):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby"><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">true</span> &amp;&amp; <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">true</span> == <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">true</span>
<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">false</span> &amp;&amp; <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">true</span> == <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">false</span>
<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">false</span> || <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">true</span> == <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">true</span>
<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">false</span> || <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">false</span> == <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">false</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>&amp;&amp;</code> is the boolean 'and' operator, and <code>||</code> is the boolean 'or'
operator. There are others (like 'not'), but let's focus on these two.
</p>

<p>
What if we treated the binary digit <code>0</code> as false, and the binary digit
<code>1</code> as true?<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup> We could do something very similar:
</p>

<pre class="example">
1 &amp; 1 == 1
1 &amp; 0 == 0
1 | 0 == 1
0 | 0 == 0
</pre>

<p>
Most programming languages will have these operators - <code>&amp;</code> is 'bitwise
and', and <code>|</code> is 'bitwise or'. They work by looking at numbers as a
series of bits and comparing the bits at the equivalent positions. They
then treat the two bits they're comparing like booleans above, and they
use the resulting bit to construct a new number - the result. It's
probably easier to see than to describe - let's stick another two digits
on to the examples above:
</p>

<pre class="example">
001 &amp; 101 == 001 // only the last bit is set in both numbers
101 &amp; 111 == 101 // only the first and last bits are set in both numbers
100 | 010 == 110 // the first or the second bits are set in both numbers
001 | 000 == 001 // are you getting the hang of it now?
</pre>

<p>
By using the <code>|</code> operator when constructing file permissions as above,
we can avoid the bits 'overflowing' into the next digit and changing the
permission - we can think of <code>|</code> as having the meaning 'apply
permission' in this context.<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup>
</p>

<pre class="example">
permission =  004 | 004 | 004 // =&gt; 004 - no matter how many times you 'apply' it!
</pre>

<p>
and <code>&amp;</code> makes a funky way to test for which file permissions have been
set.
</p>

<pre class="example">
other_execute = 0001
if current_file.permissions &amp; other_execute != other_execute {
  // don't have execute permission!
}
</pre>

<p>
This works because, if the last bit isn't set in the
<code>current_file.permissions</code>, the result of <code>&amp;=ing it with =0001</code> will
<i>always</i> be <code>0</code>
</p>

<pre class="example">
0000 &amp; 0001 // =&gt; 0000
0006 &amp; 0001 // =&gt; 0000
0742 &amp; 0001 // =&gt; 0000
0001 &amp; 0001 // =&gt; 0001
0777 &amp; 0001 // =&gt; 0001
</pre>

<p>
There are other bitwise operators - really, really funky ones that
produce an 'exclusive or', shift bits to the left and right, and invert
all the bits in a number ('bitwise not'). Take a look at them if you
have time.<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup>

<p>
Bits are useful as they're pretty much as low level as you <i>can</i> go when
programming. When you know that an integer is stored in 64 bits, it will
give you a good idea of just how large that number can be.
</p>

<p>
Bytes are probably the smallest abstraction that you'll work with on a
day to day basis. You'll usually see them when dealing with raw
information - byte arrays and byte streams. They form the building block
of larger data structures, like strings.
</p>

<p>
Number systems like hexadecimal and octal are a common way to show data
of a number of bytes conveniently. They let you reason about the size of
the data (the number of bits needed), while also providing a convenient
way of showing that data.

<h2 id="appendix-using-dc-to-handle-conversion">Appendix: using <code>dc</code> to handle conversion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-appendix-using-dc-to-handle-conversion">
<p>
Working with binary, octal and hexadecimal - and converting between them
all and decimal - can be a pain in backside. To avoid trying to do all
the maths on your fingers (and toes), I recommend using some sort of
calculator. Vavious tools are available online to do this for you, but a
tool is available at your fingertips if you're on a Unix-like system:
<code>dc</code>, the desk calculator.
</p>

<p>
We can tell <code>dc</code> to use different bases for input and output by using
the <code>i</code> and <code>o</code> commands - so
</p>

<pre class="example">
2 i 16 o
</pre>

<p>
will tell <code>dc</code> to use binary as its input and to output numbers in
hexadecimal. We can then input a binary number and then use <code>p</code> to print
it out as hexadecimal.
</p>

<pre class="example">
16 o 2 i 1111 p
</pre>

<p>
will return
</p>

<pre class="example">
f
</pre>

<p>
You can run this calculation through <code>dc</code> either by running it
interactively (start <code>dc</code> and then type in the expression), or by
sending the expression in with a flag
</p>

<pre class="example">
dc -e '16 o 2 i 1111 p'
</pre>

<p>
or piping it through on standard input
</p>

<pre class="example">
echo '16 o 2 i 1111 p' | dc
</pre>

<p>
It's a quick way to do the conversion, although it does takes some
practice to remember how to use <code>dc</code>.
