Part Two: Types
</p>

<div class="HTML">
<p>
&lt;/h2&gt;
</p>

</div>

<p>
/This post follows on from my
<a href="file:///posts/2016/8/9/learning-the-c-programming-language-part-1:-hello,-world/">first
post about the C programming language</a>, and is the second in a series
of posts about learning C/
</p>

<p>
C has types - what does that mean? This post is going to focus on types
and the role they perform in C. We're going to show how they're used
but, more importantly, we're going to look at why they're used.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1b00075" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="all-the-types">All the types!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-all-the-types">
<p>
A type in C is a type of <i>data</i>. For instance, if you want to use a
whole number in C you can use an <code>int</code>, whereas if you want to use a
decimal number you would need a different type of data, say a <code>float</code>.
</p>

<p>
The first temptation to watch out for, definitely from the Ruby side of
my brain, is to think of types as being like classes. Types are ways of
storing data in a computer (as we'll make clear), and not objects with
methods, inheritance, attributes and all the other object oriented
stuff. Forget about classes.
</p>

<p>
So to store an integer C has <code>int</code>. But it also has <code>long</code>, which will
store a bigger integer, and, on top of that we have <code>long long</code>, which
will store a <i>really</i> big integer. And if you just happen to know that
the number you want to store is <i>really</i>, <i>really</i> big but will never be
negative, you can go so far as to use the type <code>unsigned long long</code>.
</p>

<p>
This may all sound a little ridiculous from the point of view of a
Rubyist or a JavaScripter - I mean, I can see why maybe a <code>float</code> is
different to an <code>int</code>, but why do I need all these different ways to
talk about integers?
</p>

<p>
The reason cuts to the heart of what a type system is for, and why C is
a lower level programming language than Ruby and JavaScript.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfabe1c1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="types-for-the-memory">Types for the memory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-types-for-the-memory">
<p>
In C when we declare a variable we declare it with its type:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333;">my_number</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can then assign a value to it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333;">my_number</span>;
my_number = 5;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In Ruby, you'd just need the second line, and in JavaScript it would be
the same but <code>int</code> would be replaced with <code>var</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
So, what's going on under the hood of your computer when you say "OK
computer, let's have a variable"?
</p>

<p>
This is the bit where I remember the video of the American politician
explaining that the internet is just a series of tubes.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> Well, I'm
about to be just as reductivist and say that your computer's memory is
'just' a big long line of ones and zeroes.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="file:///images/c-types/bits.png" alt="bits.png">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>a series zeroes and ones</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
So Matrix.
</p>

<p>
Each one of these ones and zeroes is called a <i>bit</i> (Binary DigIT -
geddit?). And eight of those in a row is called a <i>byte</i> (no idea, you
look it up).<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> Byte is a good level of abstraction to work from for
C, so let's replace our image of a <i>very</i> long list of zeroes and ones
with a <i>very</i> long row of boxes, each box holding a byte of information.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="file:///images/c-types/bytes.png" alt="bytes.png">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>a series of empty boxes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Less Matrix, but we're cool, right?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org50ed82d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="why-we-have-types">Why we have types</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-we-have-types">
<p>
So now we need to do something with this memory - write programs! Ok,
more specifically, we need to keep hold of an integer. And we can do
this by reserving a specific portion of that <i>very</i> long row of boxes to
keep the number in. But how many boxes do we need to do that? Well,
basic maths tells us that a single byte could hold any number from 0 up
to 255 as long as it's positive.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> Cool - so now we can keep hold of
the number 5.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="file:///images/c-types/5-in-one.png" alt="5-in-one.png">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>a series of empty boxes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
But we might need to store much bigger numbers - what if we added 255 to
our that variable, we'd not have enough space to store the number 260.
So maybe we should reserve more bytes in memory to hold that number. How
many? I don't know, maybe 128 of them, just to be safe.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="file:///images/c-types/5-in-128.png" alt="5-in-128.png">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>a series of empty boxes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
But isn't that terribly inefficient? We'd just be reserving a lot of
bytes which would always be <code>0</code> if we never kept a number bigger than
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I mean, this is C - the year is 1971, the most memory we're going to</li>
</ol>
<p>
have available is 64KB. We don't want to run out of memory messing
around with piddly little positive integers&#x2026; how much space do we need
to allocate to store a number?
</p>

<p>
And that's why we have different types for different magnitudes of
integer. For small numbers there's things like <code>char</code> (a single byte)
and <code>int</code>, and for bigger numbers we've got the mighty <code>long long</code> and
<code>unsigned long long</code>.
</p>

<p>
The type of a variable is the space reserved for it in your computer's
memory.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> C offers us control over memory allocation, at the price
of us actually having to care about memory.
</p>

<p>
For instance, <code>char</code> which is good for storing information about a
single ASCII characters (more about them later). But if we need to keep
hold of a number bigger than 255, we can go with <code>int</code>, which is
guaranteed to store a number between −32767 to 32767, which is two
bytes.
</p>

<p>
We say "guaranteed", because a system's implementation of C could
allocate more memory to an <code>int</code>, so the C standard tells us the maximum
number a type can definitely store. In reality it's larger - on my
Macbook Pro the maximum size of an <code>int</code> is in fact between -2147483648
and 2147483647 - four bytes in fact.

<h2 id="integer-overflow">Integer overflow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-integer-overflow">
<p>
Let's try some of this stuff out - here's a fun program.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #cdad00; font-weight: bold;">#include</span> <span style="color: #666666;">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">main</span>() {
    <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333;">int_number</span>;
    int_number = 2000000000;
    printf(<span style="color: #666666;">"int_number: %d\n"</span>, int_number);

    int_number = int_number + 2000000000;
    printf(<span style="color: #666666;">"int_number + 2000000000: %d\n"</span>, int_number);
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here we've got the <code>main()</code> function again, which will runs on
execution. We're declaring a variable of type <code>int</code> called <code>int_number</code>
on line 4 and assigning it the value of two billion on line 5. Then
we're printing it out - <code>printf()</code> can take a format string as its first
argument, allowing later arguments to be interpolated into the string -
<code>%d</code> is the placeholder for an <code>int</code> to be inserted, so the value of
<code>int_number</code> is printed instead of the <code>&amp;d</code> in the string.
</p>

<p>
Then we reassign <code>int_number</code> to the value of <code>int_number</code> plus another
two billion. And finally we print out the value of <code>int_number</code> again.
</p>

<p>
To compile and run it take a look at the
<a href="file:///posts/2016/8/9/learning-the-c-programming-language-part-1:-hello,-world/">first
post in this series</a>. Try it now and see what you get.
</p>

<p>
Something pretty odd, right? Maybe it'll be different on your computer
but here for me the result of 2000000000 + 200000000 is -294967296.
Which is just wrong.
</p>

<p>
What happened? Well we just experienced
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow">integer overflow</a></i>,
where C quite happily adds two numbers together and stores them in a
variable, but if the type of the variable isn't big enough to hold the
new number C will just store as many bits as it can in the space it's
got. Look, try this variation:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #cdad00; font-weight: bold;">#include</span> <span style="color: #666666;">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">main</span>() {
    <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #333333;">int_number</span>;
    int_number = 2147483647;
    printf(<span style="color: #666666;">"int_number: %d\n"</span>, int_number);

    int_number = int_number + 1;
    printf(<span style="color: #666666;">"int_number + 2000000000: %d\n"</span>, int_number);
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You should get -2147483648, not 2147483648.
</p>

<p>
Integer overflow is like the moment when all the numbers on your car's
odometer are all 9s, and then they all roll over at once to all the 0s -
you've run out of space to represent the new number with digits you're
using. And for 'digits' in our example read 'bits' - <code>1111111111111111</code>
becomes <code>0000000000000000</code>, which is the representation of -2147483648
in binary.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>

<h2 id="fixing-integer-overflow">Fixing integer overflow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-fixing-integer-overflow">
<p>
To solve this problem we need a <code>bigger boat</code> larger type to store our
number in, which is as easy as changing an <code>int</code> to a
<code>unsigned long long</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #cdad00; font-weight: bold;">#include</span> <span style="color: #666666;">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

    <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">unsigned</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">long</span> <span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">long</span> <span style="color: #333333;">int_number</span>;
    int_number = 2000000000;
    printf(<span style="color: #666666;">"int_number: %d\n"</span>, int_number);

    int_number = int_number + 2000000000;
    printf(<span style="color: #666666;">"int_number + 2000000000: %d\n"</span>, int_number);
}

We should now be getting a nice round four billion.

numbers</a> <i>always</i> take up 8 bytes - big enough to handle most numbers -

In practice when I write C, I start with using =int=s, wait until I see
errors that are due to integer oveflow, and then find and replace to
change the <code>int=s to =long long</code> or <code>unsigned long long</code>. In practice,
on my highly specced modern computer, I'm not too worried about
tinkering with how much memory I'm using for my toy C programs.

This may be a contentious statement. Here I'm refering to type as
early programmers would have understood the idea of a type of
data, rather than the types of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theory</a>, based
on Bertrand Russell's solution to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox">set theoretic

way of Alonzo Church and languages like ML and which functional
programmers tend to wax lyrical about in languages like Scala.
