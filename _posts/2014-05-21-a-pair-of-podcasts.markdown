Trying to bootstrap myself into software development is a struggle. A struggle
with some successes - I mean, let&rsquo;s not forget that I'm writing this in
markdown using vim using jekyll to create a static site that&rsquo;s being
hosted with GitHub Pages; a few months ago I wouldn&rsquo;t have known what that
meant. But a struggle none the less.

I&rsquo;ve always found immersion to be key to being able to get my head around
a subject - just hammering away until it starts to make sense. A great help in
all of this has been a pair of fantastic podcasts from Envylabs, [*Five Minutes
of JavaScript*][5JS] and [*Ruby 5*][Ruby5] (it was only when I came to Google
&ldquo;JavaScript 5&rdquo; that it became clear why they went with the
convoluted title...).

Both podcasts are short - seven minutes max - and just list down anything
that&rsquo;s going on with the two languages at the moment. They&rsquo;re
broadcast twice weekly, keeping the information fresh and pertinent. At first
I had very little idea what was going on - technologies I&rsquo;d never heard of
doing things I couldn&rsquo;t understand, updates, new 'gems'... all a bit of
a mystery.

But the short format, and regular broadcasts, encouraged listening. I can catch
up in five minutes when waiting for a train, walking the dog, popping to the
shops. And it&rsquo;s started to pay off; I now understand about 70% of what's
going on in each episode, and I'm using the technologies they talk about (like
jekyll).

I've tried other podcasts and audios - chiefly lecture series from some of
America's great institutions such as Harvard's [CS50][Harvard] course available
from [EdX][Harvard], and Stanford's [Programming Methodology][Stanford] course
(which I enjoy a lot). While these broad academic courses are both informative
and entertaining, and helpful, I'm still not at the point where the subjects
under discussion are anything more than reinforcement to my study of Ruby and
JavaScript. I'm sure it will also click into place eventually, much like the
Envylabs podcasts.

It's worth mentioning the player I'm using too - [Player FM][PlayerFM] is maybe
the best thing I've ever used to play a podcast. Does everything you want, does
nothing you don't and sits on the phone occasionally telling you when there's
a new episode.
