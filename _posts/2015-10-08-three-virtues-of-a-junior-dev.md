>We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a
>programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris.
><br>&mdash;<cite>Larry Wall</cite>

You may have come across this quote before. It comes from the first
edition of _Programming Perl_ by Larry Wall, and gets bandied around
regularly as a bit of a motto or a mantra.

It makes sense in context - my _laziness_ inspires me to automate and
write clear code, _impatience_ makes me want to make things happen
faster, and _hubris_ is the gods-defying pride that makes me think I can
do this all in the first place.

But I can't help but think that these aren't good virtues for a
current software developer - they're very insular and isolating. And
they definitely aren't appropriate for a junior who's just starting
out.

So I've tried to think about what my cardinal virtues of a good junior
would be. And perhaps they're also those of a good senior too.

### Ignorance

>I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance.
><br>&mdash;<cite>Socrates</cite>

OK - maybe not the most obvious one. But if you've ever heard the
phrase 'turn a vice into a virtue' before, then you'll know where I'm
coming from.

The great thing about ignorance is that you have _so much of it_ as a
junior. It's a limitless resource. And we're confronted with it every
day we write code. There has not been a single day that I've been
sitting in front of a computer that I've not felt _dumb_ in some way.

So get used to that feeling, get really comfortable because, as far as
I can tell, it never goes away. And that's OK.

If there's one thing I learned at Makers Academy, it was to be comfortable
with my ignorance - to embrace it, and to turn it to my advantage. Every
time you don't know something, find out. Be dogged, enjoy the chase, and
at the end you will know something new. As long as you have a way of turning
ignorance to knowledge, as long as you 'know how to know', then your
infinite supply of ignorance is an infinite supply of knowledge in
disguise.

Through the alchemy of learning we turn ignorance into knowledge.

### Enthusiasm

When you start working as a junior you know practically nothing. I
arrived halfway through the creation of a multi-web-app microservice
architected web-scraping and alerting project, written in Groovy and
NodeJS and hooked together with RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

And of the above, the things I was most comfortable with were the Node
and the Mongo. And I was really uncomfortable with those.

So, presented with that, what do you have to offer. Well, you've got a
few handy mantras you can throw in to the mix now and then ("We should
write a test"), and happily most programming languages have the same
ideas and principles behind them (Groovy is enough like Ruby to wing it).

But those sorts of skills are not going to be in short supply whererver you
write your code.

What will be in short supply is _enthusiasm_ for coding. The other
developers you are working will have been doing this for years, if not
decades. They may be jaded an cynical, they may be enthusiastic, but
there is no way that they can be anywhere near as enthusiastic as you
are right now. You're living the dream, right? You're writing real life
computer code _for a living!_

So hone in on and harness that emotion - see if you can increase it.
Just being amazingly pleased and excited to be working on whatever you're
working on, all the way up to 11, will inspire your pair to work more.
They'll want to explain more, want to work with you more, become more
enthusiastic themselves because of your enthusiasm.

If you aren't enthusiastic about coding at this stage of your career,
when will you be?

### Bravery

>When you're going through hell, keep going
><br>&mdash;<cite>Churchill</cite>

You must be brave. If you're not brave you will find it near
impossible to do what I've already outlined above - because learning
to code and being a junior developer is really, _really_ hard. This
is coming from someone who has deliberately cultivated a persona of
effortless skill for most of his life. Do the same if you wish, but
don't kid yourself that beneath that serene, swan-like progress, there
are a pair of legs kicking out furiously just to stay still.

You must be brave in order to cope with your ignorance, to face it and
accept it every day. To know that you are going to be defeated and
humiliated by your computer and yet come back for more. You must be
brave to do that and to still remain enthusiastic.

You must be brave because everything is and will always be
frightening. Everything in coding comes with such big words that
everyone else seems to understand, with a new library coming along
every two minutes and a host of computer science concepts you've never
heard of getting bandied about by your colleagues. Coding has its own
culture and cant (in the sense of a [secret language]) that you'll be
desperate to get inside of, if only so that you can get the jokes on
[xkcd]. And it's scary.

You must be brave because one of the scariest things to say in the
middle of a team conversation about how you're going to create a
message queue is "Sorry, I don't know what a message queue is". And
you need to say it, and you need to keep asking what seem like stupid
questions of your colleagues, or you will be wasting everyone's time -
especially yours.

Victor Hugo has it that "curiosity is one of the forms of feminine
bravery",[^1] and this is the also the sense of bravery I'm driving
at - of daring to know no matter the danger to your self-esteem. You
will feel better and be better for it.

You must be brave enough to feel stupid all the time, and to still
be curious.
