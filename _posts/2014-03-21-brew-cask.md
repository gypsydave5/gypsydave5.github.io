[Homebrew] is wonderful, and if you're using a Mac to develop on and aren't
using it to manage your command line applications then I'd be surprised.
Actually, I'd assume you were using [MacPorts].

I've recently started to take advantage of an additonal library of prebuilt
binaries for Homebrew called [Cask]. This gives access to many (if not all) of
the larger, often graphical, applications that you need, such as Chrome,
IntelliJ, Vagrant... it's a long list.

It even integrates well with my favourite Mac productivity tool, [Alfred]. And,
yes, you can install that with Cask too.

Set up with:

```bash
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
```

and then install software with:

```bash
brew cask install alfred
```
