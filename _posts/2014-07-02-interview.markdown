A few months ago Steven Ovadia over at [My Linux Rig][MLR] spotted my post
about [the night I installed Linux][lateLinux] and asked me if I'd like to do a quick
interview about, well, about my Linux setup. Sounded like a good idea so
I answered his questions. He posted [the interview][interview] today and
if you'd like to look at it.

If there's any amendments that need to be made now that I've been using Linux
for, oh, about 20 times as long as I had been, it would have to be that I find
myself wrestling with the system more - but in a good way. I know that I can
make it do the things I want it to if I just invest a bit of time and effort to
find out how. Linux doesn't make me 'put up and shut up' - it actively
encourages me to fix things, make it suit me. This sort of experimentation and
investigation takes time, but it's ultimately very rewarding - I know my way
around my Linux machine better than my Windows set up.

In addition I rarely touch ST3 any more, spending most of my editing time on
Vim as [previously mentioned][vim]. And Guake lost its novelty rapidly. Right now I'm
sifting through five years of Gmail using [Mutt][Mutt]. Now that's something.

Probably the most affecting bit is to see the phrase 'David Wickes, Software
Developer' at the top. I'm not a software developer - yet. But I will be soon.
And reading that, well, it made me feel pretty good about myself. Something to
aspire to.
