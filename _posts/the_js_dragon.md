That's how Enrique's email introduced the Friday challenge at the end of week
8 at Makers. Week 8 has been Hell Week. It was a beasting. It was hard. It was
NodeJS.

I was looking forward to this week more than any other - it's a great idea. More
and more devs and companies are using Node, Rails is so opinionated as to be
stifiling - so why not do another week of JavaScript dedicated to Node? Throw
some CoffeeScript in there for good measure along with a seasoning of WebSockets
and you've got a recipe for succeess.

Nope. See above. You've got a recipe for Hell Week.
